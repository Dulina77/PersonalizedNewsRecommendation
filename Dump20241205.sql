The interim budget 2024-25 to be presented by Sitharaman on February 1, will be a vote-on-account that will give the government authority to spend certain sums of money till a new government comes to office after the April-May general elections.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs the Parliamentary elections are due, Sitharaman’s interim budget may not contain any major policy changes. Speaking at an industry event last month, Sitharaman had ruled out any “spectacular announcement” in the interim budget, saying it would just be a vote-on-account before the general elections.\nA vote-on-account, once approved by Parliament, will authorise the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India on a pro-rata basis to meet expenditure for the April-July period.\nThe new government, which is likely to be formed around June, will come up with a final budget for 2024-25 sometime in July. Usually, interim budgets do not contain major policy announcements, but nothing stops the government from taking steps which are necessary to deal with the urgent issues facing the economy.\nAfter the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19. It was in 2017, that Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting budget on the last working day of February to 1st of the month.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPiyush Goyal, who was holding the additional charge of the ministry due to ill health of Jaitley, presented the interim budget for 2019-20 on February 1, 2019. Goyal had hiked standard deduction for salaried taxpayers by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. Also, the tax rebate for taxpayers whose annual taxable income did not exceed Rs 5 lakh was increased from Rs 2,500 to Rs 12,500.\nAfter the 2019 general elections, in the Modi 2.0 Government, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio. She became the second woman to have presented a budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71.\nThat year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a ‘bahi-khata’ with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUnder Sitharaman, India has weathered the Covid pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag of the fastest growing major economy and a ‘bright spot’ in the world economy.\nIndia is racing to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2027-28 and USD 30 trillion by 2047. Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who holds the tag of presenting 10 budgets — the maximum by any finance minister — had presented six of them, including one interim, in a row.\nThe first budget of Independent India was presented by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.\nSitharaman, who will be presenting her sixth budget in a row, is expected to come up with some measures, especially to boost the rural sector as the agriculture sector growth in 2023-24 is estimated to decelerate to 1.8 per cent, from 4 per cent, in the preceding year.\nRakesh Nangia, Chairman, Nangia Andersen India said given the proximity to the elections, the budget is expected to focus on immediate fiscal needs rather than introducing broad long-term economic reforms.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the last interim budget for FY 2019-20, while the overall tax structure remained unchanged, there were certain specific tax rebates and standard deduction concessions. “While major announcements may be deferred until after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the budget is expected to address ongoing concerns and lay the foundation for future economic growth. This strategic approach aims to balance immediate fiscal responsibilities with long-term economic objectives in a pre-election context,” Nangia said. \n ','Technology'),(2,'‘Will densify network, want to be at least no. 2 in any city pair’: Air India Express MD','The merger of Tata group’s budget airlines Air India Express (AI Express) and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) into one carrier — AI Express — is on track for completion in the next three to four months, even as operational integration of the two is nearly complete. According to AI Express’s Managing Director Aloke Singh, the airline in its brand-new avatar aspires to double its market share by 2028, more than triple its fleet size to 180 aircraft, and build a dense network focussed on tier-two and tier-three cities, all while working in synergy with parent Air India to realise the group’s vision of emerging as a formidable player in India and beyond.\nIn an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Singh gives a lowdown of AI Express’s vision and strategy to chart ambitious growth in the coming years. Edited Excerpts:\nHow is the integration of AI Express and AIX Connect coming along?\nThe past year has been all about the integration, which involves integrating systems, processes, platforms, people, brand, networks and fleets. We have tweaked the combined network to facilitate flows between the two networks. That integration is now moving into a merger, which we hope to complete in three to four months. Simultaneously, a massive growth agenda has kicked in. We are now inducting aircraft at a rate of three-and-a-half per month, and it will continue for a while.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith steady supply of new aircraft, what shape will your network take?\nThe new capacity will help us grow significantly. This growth will come from our existing markets as well as some new ones. In our existing markets, we will densify the network and plug gaps that we could not address earlier due to capacity constraints. The broad network strategy is that we will first consolidate our presence and become stronger wherever we already operate. We want to be at least the number two player in any city pair. We don’t want to open too many new stations together. We want to open one station, deploy capacity there to increase connectivity, and spread out from there. As we become firm in a market, it will also help us in rationalising costs.\nAI Express was almost exclusively a short-haul international carrier while AIX Connect was a domestic airline. Should we expect the combined entity to be more focussed on the domestic market?\nIf you put the two networks together, we roughly have 50 per cent capacity each on domestic and international. This will remain so for the next year or two. The domestic portion will then grow to some extent. We will probably end up with about 60 per cent domestic and 40 per cent international. The domestic market is much bigger and our capacity deployment will reflect that.\nIn terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments—15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international.\nWhat is the status of network optimisation at the group level between the full-service carrier (Air India) and the budget carrier (AI Express)?\nIt has started and will be a continuous process as the nature of markets is dynamic. Route rationalisation at the group level has begun. Different operational models suit different markets. If we see that a market is better served in financial terms by the low-cost model, then we will deploy the relevant product. There will be markets where operating premium products will offer an upside, so the full-service product will be offered there. In markets and segments that are big and deep enough, we would look at straddling both product offerings.\nADVERTISEMENT\n The market sees IndiGo, which has a domestic market share of over 60 per cent, as your biggest competitor. How do you look at that challenge?\nThe market is big enough and deep enough, and has space for a number of players. The broad thrust of our network strategy will be a lot more focus on tier-two and tier-three cities. We will also focus on international operations from tier-two cities, because that is a space we understand very well. We will not be concentrating our capacity on large cities. Of course, there will be some capacity deployed there, but a large part will be for tier-two, tier-three cities.\nSo, you are looking at a point-to-point network instead of hub-and-spoke?\nYes, it will not be focussed on a large hub. However, our network will have a number a focus cities, probably 10, where we will also transfer passengers. Like, Kochi may not be a hub per se, but it has significant potential for domestic-to-domestic, international-to-domestic, and even international-to-international transfers. Similarly, we are connecting Bangalore, where we have a dense network, to our points in Kerala. For example, we can offer travel from Ayodhya to Kochi via Bangalore, or a Lucknow-Bangalore-Trivandrum connection.\nAir India Express operated Boeing 737s while AIX Connect had Airbus A320s. Do you now plan to operate both or retire the A320s?\nWe will have a mixed fleet. You have to look at the fleet from the group perspective. The fleet will be fungible. We want that flexibility. Having a mixed fleet may have some sub-optimality, but with scale, fleet commonality benefits diminish. If you have 200 or 300 or 400 aircraft, due to the large scale of operations, a mixed fleet is not too different from a single-type fleet.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOur plan is to have a fleet size of about 180 aircraft by 2028. We have a legacy fleet of 26 737NGs (737 Next Generation), of which 10 are leased, and 28 A320s, all of which are leased. The leased aircraft will start going back to lessors starting this year.\nThe Air India group’s 470-aircraft order includes 190 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Are all of those going to come to Air India Express?\nSo far, we have not taken that call at the group level. The aircraft deliveries will stretch over years. Some of the Airbus A320s and A321s (also part of the order) may even come our (Air India Express) way. Aircraft type within the group will remain fungible given the long delivery schedule and the decisions will be based on synergies within the group like aircraft engineering and maintenance. But certainly, Air India Express will operate under an all-economy model.\nConsidering Air India Express has mostly been a short-haul international carrier and given the growth trajectory you are eyeing, are you looking to get into wide-body operations as well?\nNo, we have no such plans at present. We first want to grow and scale up with our current model (low-cost domestic and short-haul international operations), before thinking about anything else.\nBy when can we see your legacy fleet in the new Air India Express branding?\nWe are not going to change the livery on the legacy fleet. One reason is that many of those aircraft will be going back to lessors once the leases expire. Secondly, we want to prioritise the new aircraft, as the painting capacity in the MROs (maintenance, repair, and overhaul units) is limited. We want to paint the new aircraft first and then take a call on the older ones. In any airline’s livery change programme, it takes years for 100 per cent of the aircraft to get rebranded.\nGiven your thrust on tier-two and tier-three cities, will we see Air India Express applying for routes under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik)?\nCertainly, we could look at it, if it fits into our route strategy. We would be really interested in international UDAN, but there could be some domestic routes also that could make sense for us.','Business'),(3,'Air India group to induct an aircraft every six days throughout this year','The Air India group plans to induct one aircraft every six days on an average throughout 2024, including five more Airbus A350 wide-body aircraft, and 46 Boeing 737 and 17 Airbus A320 narrow-body planes, Air India’s Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Campbell Wilson said Thursday in a message to staff ahead of the second anniversary of the carrier’s return to the Tata group. Apart from these 68 planes—part of the Air India group’s mammoth 470-aircraft order placed in 2023—four leased Boeing 777 wide-body planes will also join the carrier’s fleet.\nAir India currently has 117 operational aircraft in its fleet, while its arm Air India Express has 63 planes. Under the new owners, Air India has been able to bring back to service 90 per cent of its long-grounded aircraft as well.\nApart from fleet expansion, 2024 will also see Air India kick off the full interior refit of 40 legacy wide-body aircraft—Boeing 777s and 787s. The upgradation exercise, which will include complete replacement of seats and in-flight entertainment system on the legacy wide-body fleet, is expected to start in July, coinciding with Air India’s first A350 aircraft starting international operations. The plane, which started commercial operations this week, is initially flying domestic sectors for a few months for crew familiarisation flights. Air India also plans to start interior upgrades on 41 narrow-body A320 aircraft as well this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Though we still have a long way to go to upgrade the legacy fleet, improve our consistency, close remaining gaps and strengthen fragile processes, the future is now more visible, more tangible and, I hope, more inspiring. Despite—and no doubt somewhat because of—the good progress we’ve made in two short years since privatisation, expectations are high, so we need to keep rising to meet them,” Wilson said.\nOver the past two years, Air India has augmented its legacy fleet by taking 36 aircraft on lease, apart from pacing the giant 470-aircraft order with Airbus and Boeing. It has added five domestic and 11 international routes to its network, and opened five new international stations. New brand identities for both Air India and Air India Express were also launched last year.\nEver since Air India returned to the Tata group on January 27, 2022, the new owners have been focusing on sprucing up the product offering, while also planning an extensive expansion for the airline. A five-year roadmap–Vihaan.AI–was prepared with the objective of substantially growing the airline’s network and fleet in a bid to put it on a “path to sustained growth, profitability, and market leadership”.\nAs per data shared by Wilson with staff, Air India clocked 249 per cent revenue growth over the past two years, while Air India Express’s revenue grew 148 per cent over the period. Wilson did not give further details on the group’s financials.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“In the context of our starting point, the size and scope of the transformation we’re undertaking, our unprecedented multi-carrier integration, our huge growth and product-improvement aspirations and our capability-building requirements, two years is an incredible short time. Indeed, we are not even 18 months into our 5-year Vihaan.AI transformation program. But even so, as the infographic shows, the progress made in two short years is quite remarkable and is testament to the commitment, energy and hard work of all Air Indians,” Wilson said.\nThe Tata group is in the process of consolidating its airline business by merging Air India and Vistara to create one full-service carrier under the Air India brand, and Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) to create one budget airline under the Air India Express brand. While the operational integration of Air India Express and AIX Connect is complete, the merger of Air India and Vistara is expected sometime in 2025.','Business'),(4,'Red Sea woes: Exporters seek increased credit as freight rates jump 300%','Indian exporters have asked the central government to help facilitate more credit as freight rates have jumped nearly 300 per cent due to the disruption in the Red Sea route forcing global shipping lines to take longer trade routes, which is ultimately affecting exports of low value items such as Basmati rice.\nIncreasing attacks on ships sailing in the Red Sea region since November 2023 have forced shippers to consider the alternative, longer route past the Cape of Good Hope, which has not only stretched delivery time by 15 to 20 days, but also increased the transit cost substantially because of incremental freight rates and insurance premium.\nFederation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai told The Indian Express that freight costs have surged by 300 per cent as global shipping lines are taking the Cape of Good Hope route, which is why exporters have sought more credit to match the rising cost of shipments to Europe.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMeanwhile, ratings agency Crisil on Thursday said that players operating in sectors such as agricultural commodities and marine foods could see a significant impact due to the perishable nature of their goods or lean margin profiles, which limit their ability to absorb the risks from rising freight cost.\n“Not all sectors are expected to be impacted to the same extent. In fact, for agricultural commodities like Basmati rice (30-35% of production is shipped to these regions), exporters are feeling the pressure as rising freight cost has curbed exports and a part of their inventory is now being sold in the domestic market, leading to a moderation in realisations,” the report said.\nIndian companies use the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, North Africa, and parts of the west Asia. Crisil said that these regions accounted for 50 per cent of India’s exports worth Rs 18 lakh crore and 30 per cent of imports worth Rs 17 lakh crore last fiscal.\n“Marine foods –predominantly shrimp and prawn – could also see a significant impact as 80-90 per cent of the production is exported, more than half of it through the Red Sea. Their perishable nature and lean margins make exporters vulnerable to rising freight cost and competitive pressure from Latin American suppliers,” the report added.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Indian Express had earlier reported that the finance ministry is set to hold a high-level meeting on February 5 to ensure smooth trade payments amid challenges emanating from the disruption in the Red Sea region.','Technology'),(5,'Air India group to induct a plane every 6 days throughout 2024; kick off legacy fleet revamp','The Air India group plans to induct one aircraft every six days an average throughout 2024, including five more Airbus A350 wide-body aircraft, and 46 Boeing 737 and 17 Airbus A320 narrow-body planes, Air India’s Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Campbell Wilson said Thursday in a message to staff ahead of the second anniversary of the carrier’s return to the Tata group.

The model code of conduct (MCC), likely to be implemented next month, is being viewed as a final cutoff date, with hectic last-minute parleys being escalated to the highest level in the Indian government across ministries including commerce, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs to thrash out a final consensus, a government official said.\nThe FTA with the UK would be the first full fledged deal with a western country that would see deeper economic integration with a major global service sector leader. However, the window to sign the deal is fast closing with elections in both the countries this year. While the general election in the UK is expected in December this year, India’s general elections are likely to take place between April and May this year.\nThe UK FTA is crucial as it will serve as a template for trade deals with larger western trade partners such as the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Economic integration with the western countries through FTA assumes significance as the global supply chain is undergoing a reset after covid-19 and multinational companies globally are adopting a China plus one policy. Multilateral trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) are also being negotiated in a bid to shift away from dependence on China.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“For us (India) MCC is the cutoff. Our UK counterpart understands this and that is the reason their officials are here and meetings are ongoing with the highest level of the government across ministries including commerce ministry, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs,” the official said.\nA delegation from the UK arrived in India on January 22.\n“All chapters are closed but a handful of articles in a few chapters are remaining. It is a small basket now. Over 90 per cent of the deal has been closed. There have been several issues and chapters closed in the last three months,” the official added.\nThe MCC is a code containing general precepts for model behaviour during elections conducted by Election Commission (EC). It has an entire chapter on what the party in power can and cannot do once elections are announced which forbids use of official machinery and personnel for the political gains of the party in power.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHence, the spirit of MCC also requires the bureaucracy or any public servant to not engage or appear to engage in an activity that could work to the advantage of the party in power. Notably, the MCC is only a moral code and lacks any statutory backing, the EC, at best, can censure, advise or pull up the person found violating it.\nWith the date for MCC fast approaching, India is looking to close two other FTAs including the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Free Trade Association with the four nation bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\nHowever, the comprehensive trade deal with Australia is likely to be taken up after the general elections as Australian negotiators are seeking access into India’s agricultural market, which is a sensitive sector for India.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the UK has asked India to reduce duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. The final deal could see India lower duty to a greater extent as India is a high tariff country. The average tariff on goods imported from India into the UK is 4.2% but the average tariff in India on goods imported from the UK is 14.6%\nNegotiations on cars and whisky have been contentious as Indian industry has been seeking greater access into the UK market too. Indian whisky manufacturers have said that the UK should ease its three year maturation rule, which acts as a barrier for Indian whisky brands seeking entry into the UK, and is seeking duty concessions in the auto sector, particularly in the EV segment.\nIndia’s labour-intensive sectors are expected to see gains from the India-UK FTA, especially the textile sector. Indian textile exports face tariffs as high as 10% in the UK and a trade deal could put India on par with competition such as Bangladesh (which get LDC benefits), and revive textile exports. Meanwhile a greater integration in the services sector with the UK could help greater job creation in the fast growing industry.\nIndia and the UK are also looking to sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) alongside the FTA that could improve UK’s investments into India. To resolve investor-state disputes under the new BIT faster, India is expected to move away from its 2016 model BIT approach that stressed on exhaustion of local remedies.\nIn FY2023, India’s merchandise exports to the UK were valued at $11.41 billion while imports stood at $8.96 billion.','Sports'),(10,'Govt close to saturation in implementing social sector schemes: Nirmala Sitharaman','Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said the government is close to reaching saturation in implementing social sector schemes designed to provide basic necessities to the poor. Addressing the students of Hindu College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, she said the time has come for India to become economically ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) and march forward to become a developed nation by 2047.\nRegretting that 60 years since Independence passed without any sense of urgency, Sitharaman said, “we have laid the material foundation for a Viksit Bharat” and empowering people by providing basic necessities to all.\nEven earlier governments had schemes of providing houses, roads etc but the sense of urgency was missing, she said, adding, nearly 50 per cent of the population were devoid of fundamental things 50 or 60 years post independence.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“So that’s the underlying principle with which between 2014 and today we have done with a sense of urgency. Push the border forward, you take it further. Make sure everybody who’s actually eligible to get those should get it…the approach (of the government) is to empower people, skill people, give access and ensure that everyone gets good health treatment and so on,” she said.\nShe also said the government has been able to save Rs 2.5 lakh crore through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) by weeding out dummy and undesirable beneficiaries.\nDBT has not only improved transparency in the government fund transfer but also enhanced efficiency through the use of technology, she said.\nStressing that the government doesn’t differentiate between people, Sitharaman said that is the reason why the prime minister categorises India in four groups–Youth, Women, Farmers and Poor– and efforts are made for betterment of these groups irrespective of caste, creed and religion. She also said that India is nearly self-sufficient as far as agriculture is concerned except in oil seeds and pulses.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, she advocated that one should not waste food as many parts of the world are facing problems.\nTerming Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha ceremony of January 22 as a ‘civilisational marker’, she said, this was a fortunate moment for the generation who could witness restoration of civilisational values. She urged the students to focus on skill development as well as on values — both civilisational and nationalistic.\nReminding students that the country celebrates National Voters’ Day on January 25, she said, it is not just the right of citizens to vote but it is their duty also, and the first-time voters have greater responsibility.','Business'),(11,'Azim Premji gifts one crore Wipro shares to his sons','Wipro founder Azim Premji has transferred 1.02 crore equity shares of Wipro held by him to his two sons Rishad Premji and Tariq Premji as ‘gift’, according to an exchange filing.\nThe Wipro scrip is currently valued at Rs 472.9 per share, and at roughly this value, the transferred shares will amount to a whopping Rs 483 crore.

In July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government had decided to enable direct listing of listed and unlisted companies on the IFSC exchanges. The move is expected to give Indian companies access to cheaper foreign capital, boost foreign investment, and broaden investor.\nThe Department of Economic Affairs of the Finance Ministry has amended Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, and notified the Direct Listing of Equity Shares of Companies Incorporated in India on International Exchanges Scheme. Additionally, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued Companies (Listing of Equity Shares in Permissible Jurisdictions) Rules, 2024.\n“These, together, provide an overarching regulatory framework to enable public Indian companies to issue and list their shares in permitted international exchanges. As of now, the framework allows unlisted public Indian companies to list their shares on an international exchange. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is in the process of issuing the operational guidelines for listed public Indian companies,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe international stock exchanges at GIFT-IFSC—India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange—are currently prescribed as the permitted stock exchanges. These exchanges are under the regulatory supervision of the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). GIFT-IFSC is India’s first international financial services centre set up with the objective of connecting India with global opportunities while helping the Indian economy connect with the global financial system and facilitating seamless flow of global capital into India.\n“This policy initiative…will reshape the Indian capital market landscape and offers Indian companies, especially start-ups and companies in the sunrise and technology sectors, an alternative avenue to access global capital beyond the domestic exchanges. This is expected to lead to better valuation of Indian companies in line with global standards of scale and performance, boost foreign investment flows, unlock growth opportunities and broaden the investor base,” the Finance Ministry said.\nPublic Indian companies will have the flexibility to access both markets—domestic for raising capital in rupees and international market at IFSC for raising capital in foreign currency from the global investors.\n“This initiative will particularly benefit Indian companies going global and having ambitions to look at opportunities for expanding their presence in other markets.

Sebi had earlier asked FPIs to bring down such exposure by January 29, 2024.\nADVERTISEMENT\nExplained | FPI disclosure norms deadline extended: Why is SEBI seeking investor data?\nIf FPIs continue to meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of January end, they would have an added 10/30 working days to provide the additional details required, they said. “Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they would have a further 6 months to reduce their holdings,” sources said.\nSources said FPIs which met the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of October 31, 2023 had time till January 2024 end to rebalance their holdings if they so wished.\nFPIs had sold stocks worth over Rs 27,000 crore between January 17-23 in the cash market, according to stock exchange data. FPIs have offloaded Rs 19,308 crore of local shares on a net basis in January so far, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL). Net FPI outflows, after accounting for their investments in IPOs and debt market, were Rs 4,439 crore in January.\nThe Sebi’s circular came into effect on November 1, 2023. According to the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by FPI custodians on additional disclosure norms, existing FPIs, which are in breach of the investment limits as on October 31, 2023, would be required to bring down such exposure within 90 calendar days i.e. January, 29, 2024 (settlement date), unless they fall under any of the exempted categories.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to sources, FPIs which may be required to provide enhanced disclosures are expected to be significantly less than estimated in the consultation paper and the SEBI board note.\nIn May, Sebi had said that based on the data as of March 31, 2023, FPI assets under management of around Rs 2.6 lakh crore may potentially be identified as high-risk FPIs who would have to make additional disclosures.\nSources said that exemption from enhanced disclosures have been provided to FPIs which are sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), listed companies on certain global exchanges, public retail funds, and other regulated pooled investment vehicles with diversified global holdings.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe markets regulator had mandated additional disclosure norms for high risk FPIs after it observed that certain FPIs were holding concentrated portion of their equity portfolio in a single investee company/ corporate group.\nSuch concentrated investments raise the concern and possibility that promoters of such investee companies/ corporate groups, or other investors acting in concert, could be using the FPI route for circumventing regulatory requirements such as that of disclosures under Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations, 2011 (SAST Regulations) or maintaining Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) in the listed company, Sebi had said.','Technology'),(18,'Sankey Prasad is Colliers CMD for India, Middle East','Investment management firm Colliers on Wednesday announced that Sankey Prasad will expand his leadership role to include project leaders in the Middle East.\nEffective immediately, Sankey Prasad becomes Chairman and MD (CMD) for India and CMD for the Middle East Engineering business which is under the name of Colliers Project Leaders Middle East.\n“He will also take a significant stake in Colliers’ rapidly growing project management business in the Middle East, supporting the region’s flourishing real estate market in collaboration with Colliers’ existing real estate services business in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,” it said.','Technology'),(19,'Competition Commission of India okays Burmans’ Religare offer','The Competition Commission of India has given its approval for the acquisition of a 5.27 per cent stake in Religare Enterprises Ltd and a subsequent open offer to buy up to another 26 per cent of the financial services firm by entities controlled by the Burman family.\n“The acquirers are all systematically important non-deposit accepting non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) engaged primarily in the business of making investments in capital markets and providing secured and unsecured loans,” the Commission said.\nThe Burmans’ takeover plan is being stoutly opposed by the current management of Religare.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“While giving the approval, the CCI has clearly called out precise sections under which the acquirers may face action.

Also, this week is when the goods and services tax (GST) outflow happens,” said a treasury head of a private sector bank.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBanking system liquidity, as reflected by the amount of money injected by the RBI into the banking system, has been in deficit mode since last month after advance tax and goods and services tax (GST) payments.\nOn a net basis, the RBI has injected liquidity averaging Rs 1.8 trillion between December 16, 2023 and January 14, 2024.\nHigher outflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have also led to the widening of banking system liquidity, analysts said. So far in the current month, FPIs have pulled out Rs 19,308 crore of local shares on a net basis in January so far, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).\nAccording to Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda, the liquidity tightness is a case of deposits rising at a slower pace compared to the growth in credit.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the fortnight ended December 29, the bank deposits grew by 13 per cent on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, while credit grew by 20 per cent, the latest RBI data showed. The growth includes the impact of the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank.\nA large amount of retail deposits migrating to mutual funds has also resulted in a slower growth in deposits, Sabnavis said.\nThe RBI has been conducting VRR auctions to infuse liquidity into the banking system. Between December 16 and January 14, it conducted five variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of 2-7 days maturity and a main operation (13 days) amounting to Rs 1.75 lakh crore. On January 24, the RBI announced a 15-day VRR worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBankers said the RBI wants liquidity to remain in the deficit mode as consumer priced-based inflation (CPI) continues to remain above its target of 4 per cent. Retail inflation, or CPI, edged up to 5.7 per cent in December 2023 from 5.6 per cent in November.\nIf the ongoing liquidity conditions persist, the RBI will necessarily have to infuse more durable liquidity into the banking system, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in a report.\n“Sustained tightness in the banking system liquidity could prove to be onerous for borrowers and will worsen in case if government spending does not accelerate in a meaningful way. Therefore, the infusion of durable liquidity is becoming necessary and idealistically, the monetary policy stance should change to ‘neutral’ from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to maintain consistency of stance and action,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, Director, Core Analytical Group, Ind-Ra.\nWhile an increase in FPI inflow owing to the inclusion in Global Bond Indices will improve the liquidity situation, the surge in cash-in-circulation ahead of the parliamentary election will keep the RBI on toes, notwithstanding the beginning of government spending in April 2024 and relatively weak credit season, the rating agency said.','Technology'),(21,'Finance Ministry to hold key meet on trade payment issues on February 5','The Finance Ministry is set to hold a high-level meeting on February 5 to ensure smooth trade payments amid challenges emanating due to disruption in the Red Sea region.

Objective is to hear from all stakeholders and find solutions for orderly trade transactions and settlement thereof,” a senior government official told The Indian Express.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis comes a week after the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had asked the DFS to maintain credit flow to the exporters amid disruption in the Red Sea region that could impact over 80 per cent of the exports to Europe, following an inter-ministerial meeting on January 17.\nFreight rates to Europe have more than doubled due to security tension in the Red Sea region. Fears of disruptions in the Red Sea region have risen and oil prices have begun inching up ever since the US and the UK earlier this month attacked Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for the attacks on their commercial ships in the Red Sea region.\nIndian shipments of low value products such as agriculture and textiles to Europe are primarily expected to face the impact of disruption in the Red Sea region due to surging freight costs.

However, recent Houthi attacks have compelled shipping companies to reroute trade between Europe and Asia around Africa, increasing time and costs.\nThe elevated freight rates have lifted the landed cost of sunflower oil above that of soyoil in India for the first time in nearly a year, said Sandeep Bajoria, CEO of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil brokerage.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Sunoil imports were robust in the last few months due to the price advantage it had over soyoil. However, it lost this advantage because of rising freight,” he said.\nCrude sunflower oil imports are currently offered at about $943 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF), in India for February delivery, while crude soyoil is offered at around $935 and crude palm oil at $933, dealers said.\nTwo months ago, sunflower oil was trading at a $120 per ton discount to soyoil, which encouraged Indian traders to increase sunoil imports.\nIn December, India’s sunoil imports more than doubled from a month earlier to 260,850 tons.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSoyoil imports in December rose by 1.8% to 152,650 tons but remained significantly below the average imports of 306,000 tons in the marketing year that ended in October 2023.\nIn January, sunflower oil imports could fall to 225,000 tons as soyoil imports are likely to jump above 230,000 tons, said Rajesh Patel, managing partner at edible oil trader and broker GGN Research.\n“In the coming months sunflower oil imports would go down to around 200,000 tons if the current price trend continues,” Patel said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIndia buys palm oil mainly from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, while it imports soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.\nArgentina is currently offering sunoil at more competitive prices than supplies from Black Sea region countries, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trade house.

Pahlajani\nIt’s the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) season, and so amidst the anxiety and anticipation capping years of hard work, you possibly find yourself wondering: “If I can make it to one of my preferred IITs, which BTech programme should I choose?” You look up the top choices: “Okay, Computer Science, then. But I think Mechanical or Electrical Engineering may be much broader. What about Chemical or Civil?” There’s input from friends and family, which might not all of is necessarily helpful. And then, perhaps, you love the sciences, but are ambivalent about engineering, and wonder: “Is engineering even the right choice for me? Perhaps I might be better off pursuing an Integrated MSc in the physical sciences.”\nThese are difficult questions with no easy answers, and so, when the time comes, one will have to make an important life decision with incomplete information. The good news is that very often, one’s academic and professional trajectory and eventual success may not depend so much on making the perfect choice, but simply on making a good enough choice. Part of the reason is that a good BTech programme at many of the IITs is a remarkably good springboard for a variety of career paths, as is evident from the biographies of numerous distinguished IIT alumni.\nAlso read | JEE Main 2024 exam analysis, important topics\nHowever, I want to turn my attention to the last group of students mentioned above, passionate about science but unsure about engineering. I too once belonged to that group, and following conventional wisdom at the time, chose engineering (though not at an IIT). What followed were a few not-so-happy years, but I fortunately had the opportunity to take several advanced Mathematics courses, and secured admission to a PhD programme in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I wrote my doctoral thesis in Probability Theory guided by an advisor who, interestingly enough, had also started as a student in Electrical Engineering and then switched to a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I got a postdoctoral position, worked in the US for a few years, joined IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) in 2014, and lived happily ever after. More or less…\nAnyway, back to you and your predicament. Well, one thing I have learned over the years is just how versatile an engineering degree can be, provided one can also take courses in one’s area of interest, whatever that may be. This brings me back to the IITs, specifically IITGN, since it is the only IIT where I have worked. Two big strengths of the BTech programme at IITGN are equipping engineering students with a solid foundation in the basic sciences, and providing students the chance to explore numerous courses outside their major. With Mathematics, all students are required to take a few core courses: single and multivariable calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. Additionally, each engineering department may require their students to take specific courses.\nAlthough IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter). Further, students who have completed at least four semesters with satisfactory academic performance can also apply for a joint BTech/MSc dual degree, where the additional MSc degree can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. We recently had a BTech student from Mechanical Engineering take this route, also completing an MSc in Mathematics in the process. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Ohio State University.\nThe take-home message here is that with a bit of flexibility and access to Mathematics and Science courses, an Engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad for pursuing higher education and a career in these fields. Besides academics, Mathematics PhDs have found careers in Quantitative Finance, and more recently, in Data Science.

Following this, the first International Day of Education was observed on January 24, 2019.\nRead | International Education Day 2024: Indian students need to work on soft skills, say experts\nSince then, January 24 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Education. The 2024 celebration is the sixth year of celebration.\nUnderstanding this year’s theme\nThe theme of the 2024 celebrations is ‘learning for lasting peace’. The thought behind this theme has been explained by the UNESCO as: the world is seeing a surge of violent conflicts paralleled by an alarming rise of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and hate speech. The impact of this violence transcends any boundary based on geography, gender, race, religion, politics, offline and online. An active commitment to peace is more urgent today than ever: Education is central to this endeavor, as underlined by the UNESCO Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development. Learning for peace must be transformative, and help empower learners with the necessary knowledge, values, attitudes and skills and behaviours to become agents of peace in their communities.\n“The accelerated spread of hate speech is a threat to all communities. Our best defense is education, which must be at the heart of any peace efforts. It is our collective duty to empower learners of all ages to deconstruct hate speech, and lay the foundations for inclusive, democratic and human-rights respecting societies. To succeed, we need to better train and support teachers who are on the front lines in overcoming this phenomenon,” Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General said.\nKeeping this in mind, UNESCO is dedicating this year’s celebrations to the crucial role education and teachers play in countering hate speech, which has seen an increase in recent years due to the emergence of social media.\nOn January 24, UNESCO will organise a one-day online training for several thousand teachers from around the world on the deconstruction of hate speech, which will give them the tools to spot, tackle and prevent hate speech incidents.','Education'),(91,'ICAI to sign MoU with CBSE, launches study material to teach financial independence','The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) will soon be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Aniket S Talati, President, ICAI, on January 22, announced at a press conference here.\nTalking about the collaboration with CBSE, Talati added that ICAI will sign an MoU with CBSE on February 8.

Both exams — NEET for medical aspirants and JEE for engineering — demand meticulous planning and a structured approach. However, the strategies for subject-specific preparation in these exams have unique subtleties that are crucial for aspirants looking to succeed in these challenging tests.\nBiology vs. Mathematics\nNEET aspirants prioritise Biology, a substantial section of the exam (50 per cent), focusing on comprehensive understanding, memorisation, and interpretation of biological concepts, complemented by extensive reading of NCERT books. In contrast, JEE applicants delve deeply into mathematics, emphasising problem-solving skills and a profound understanding of complex mathematical concepts through various resources.\n(Graphics by Abhishek Mitra)\nRead | JEE Main 2024 Session 1 Exam Live Updates\nChemistry\nThe Chemistry syllabi of NEET and JEE share many similarities.

A perfect 20-0 record. He was 33 matches unbeaten in Melbourne, a streak that went back to 2018 – 2195 days, as the broadcasters were keen to point out every chance they got.\nSavour the moment @janniksin ?#AusOpen • #AO2024 pic.twitter.com/FTSDsa2AOp\n— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 26, 2024\nThe Serb’s dominance of the Slams, and particularly Melbourne Park, was not simply down to extraordinary tennis repertoire, but instead part of a legacy built on a near-supernatural ability to expose best-of-five tennis for the collection of short sprints that it is, as opposed to the consistent long run marathon it has always been claimed to be.\nEven when thoroughly outplayed, Djokovic has always possessed the athleticism and presence of mind to take matches deep, win the pressure points, keep himself competitive enough to give himself a chance to win the match in the finer margins.\nSo, Sinner’s statement-making victory was not completed during the first half of the match, when the solid Italian took advantage of a streaky-looking Djokovic to race into an early two-set lead. Instead, it was earned during the second half, when he prevented the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who raised his game to try to take the contest deep, from completing one of his signature comebacks.\nSuperior in all departments\nDjokovic was unquestionably flat at the start of this match, and his second-half recovery was never too convincing either, similar to his level in his first five matches of the tournament. Out of 90 completed points in the first two sets, Djokovic made 29 unforced errors.\nHe would admit to this himself, cutting a disappointed figure in his post-match press conference. “I was, in a way, shocked with my level, in a bad way,” he said. “This is one of the worst Grand Slam matches I’ve ever played, at least that I remember… This tournament hasn’t been, as I said, up to my standard or criteria or the level that I would normally play or expect myself to play”\nAnd Sinner was in diametrically opposite form.\nScintillating Sinner ???\nHe achieves the impossible defeating 10x #AusOpen champion Djokovic 6-1 6-2 6-7(6) 6-3.@janniksin • #AO2024 • @wwos • @espn • @eurosport • @wowowtennis@Kia_Worldwide • #Kia • #MakeYourMove pic.twitter.com/X6qFAtegq7\n— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 26, 2024\nBaseline strategy has formed a primary emphasis of the work he has been doing with his new coaching team – led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi’s former coach – since the start of 2022 and he nailed it in the biggest result of his career. The Italian’s lean, wiry frame and composed demeanour do not betray the full strength of the destructive power that comes off his racquet.\nHis pure ball striking ability would send Djokovic trailing to catch balls, and his aggression from start to finish allowed him to finish points before Djokovic could even get balls back into play to wear him down. Djokovic was out of sorts, but it was Sinner’s baseline prowess that had him totally out of his comfort zone, making him rush his shots and extracting errors.\nDespite it not being the highlight of his game, Sinner served exceptionally – according to Opta, this is the first Grand Slam match of Djokovic’s 19-year-long career where he did not even have a single break point opportunity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSinner won 80 of the points when the rallies were four shots or less, as opposed to Djokovic’s 43. In the first two sets, that number is 32-16, showing just how well Sinner was serving and returning, and keeping points short to keep Djokovic out of his comfort zone.\nMaintaining composure\nDjokovic was subpar throughout the match, but recovered from the first two sets reasonably, he began to raise his level just enough to make sure he can take advantage if the player on the other side of the net buckled.\nLesser players would have tightened up one set away from the biggest result of their career, but Sinner’s concentration never wavered. Even as Djokovic improved, the Italian stayed true to his aggressive strategy, and served consistently well to get over the line in the pressure moments and take the third set into a tiebreaker, where Djokovic typically showed signs of life and recovered from match point down – with an expertly executed lob no less – to edge the tiebreaker. Another famous turnaround was lurking.\nA lightning fast start from @janniksin ⚡\nThe Italian ?? captures the first set 6-1. #AusOpen • #AO2024 pic.twitter.com/SYMCmyJtk6\n— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 26, 2024\nBut Sinner never cowered, coming out in the fourth set just as he had done all match – bombing down serves, putting pressure on Djokovic through aggressive return strategy, and striking the ball as purely as he had done from the start.\nIt would be Djokovic who would blink. After saving two break points earlier in the set, his serve would be broken on a game in which he was 40-0 up. Anyone familiar with Djokovic’s history would be aware that the match is far from over, but Sinner served out the win with the freedom of a player that was not simply attempting to protect his lead, but outrightly going for the kill.\nEver since he was a teenager, hype has swirled around the lethal nature of his shotmaking and complete nature of his game. After growing into his body and peaking physically, Sinner’s tendency to collapse meant he needed to prove that he could hold his nerve against an all-time great opponent with the Grand Slam pressure on him. After picking up his third win in four matches against Djokovic, and reaching his first Major final, some of those doubts have surely been put to bed.','Technology'),(102,'Allan Border opens up about Parkinson’s disease: ‘I’m not scared, but I am worried about the slow decline process’','Legendary Australia cricketer Allan Border has opened up about his fight with Parkinson’s disease and revealed why he is scared about the “slow decline process.”\n“My health is good apart from having Parkinson’s my general health is pretty good,” Border said on Fox Cricket’s at tea on day two of the day-night pink ball Test match played between Australia and West Indies.\n“I still play golf.

One of India’s finest bludgeons from the back court, would fall back frustratingly in the endgame as his impressive strokeplay was rendered a footnote in losses.\nOn Thursday, Kiran, the world No.36, literally went ballistic in finishing in the Round of 16 at Indonesia Masters, winning 21-11, 13-21, 21-18 against China’s World No.19 Lu Guang Zu.\nAs he had missed out on opportunities to go deeper into draws, his coaches at the Prakash Padukone academy in Bangalore – Vimal Kumar, Sagar Chopda and DK Sen, had been drilling into him the importance of a strong, aggressive finish.\nKiran’s father George Thomas, had heard it all too often, how his son wasn’t pushing the pedal when required. It was a hard watch because George, the 1991 Indian national champion, was known for his blistering pace and muscled aggression while killing off points. Kiran’s soft exits stung.\nKiran’s father George Thomas was the 1991 Indian national champion.\nAfter Thursday’s win in three, his father couldn’t contain his pride and was relieved at how the lad had finally unleashed his full aggression to nick a tight decider his way.\nThe first two sets swung equally and one-sidedly in either player’s direction. But it was in the decider when Kiran was three points adrift at 8-11 that the 23-year-old came charging at Lu. The hand speed showed a visible uptick, and Kiran stalked him all the way to 18-18, not conceding more than a 1 point lead.\nThe last three points from 18-all were pristine aggression as first a growling net dribble, then a signature scythe shot from the back and finally a lightning reflex from midcourt, all played at breathless speed, gave the Indian World No.36 a swashbuckling win over No.19 Zu to make the quarterfinals of a Super 500.\n#IndonesiaMasters2024\nWow, who would have thought the last standing Indian at a Super 500 is a qualifier.

I was the opposite, very aggressive. But he has far superior strokeplay,” explained George who won subjunior, and junior Nationals in doubles and the U21 and seniors singles crown, gaining domestic renown.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Yet too many times he was leading by a big margin and still lost in recent years. People would say he lacks aggression. Internationally each point counts for a lot at the end.”\nKiran had beaten Chinese Shi Yuqi and Weng Hong Yang, who caused headaches to most Indians, rather easily last June. But a deep run in a tournament was missing, as headlines proved elusive.\nKiran had beaten Chinese Shi Yuqi and Weng Hong Yang, who caused headaches to most Indians, rather easily last June. But a deep run in a tournament was missing, as headlines proved elusive.\nAt Istora in Jakarta by Thursday, Kiran had played 4 matches including qualifying rounds, in 72 hours. All of them, three-setters.\nAfter blitzing to take the Round 2 opener against Lu to whom he’d lost 21-10, 22-20 last October, Kiran watched the Chinese regroup and retaliate. Lu has a strong power game, a decent defense, and got his straight hits going to pull Kiran into a decider. The Indian was defending well in the second, but not taking his chances falling back 3-11, and eventually submitting 13-21.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLu was hell bent in the decider on testing Kiran on the forehand far corner, pushing him back, because the Indian was proving too dangerous at the net. Lu underestimated just how good Kiran can be from the back court.\nNot only does the Indian hit deep and hard from baseline, he has perhaps the best deception amongst Indians from the back. His long hits travel with a deep baritone. Both his slow drops and fast pushes fetch him points, even if he’s chased away from the net, where his tight dribbles aren’t bad at all.\nKiran’s repertoire of disguises and strokes from the back is classical, and the footwork moving front and back from corners to centre is so smooth and swift that he is never quite pinned to the baseline. The Chinese just couldn’t thwart Kiran merely by pinging him continually to that forehand back corner. The whip on the shuttle was audible and audacious.\nMuch to the chagrin of Lu, who tried to blast through, Kiran also unfurled some stinging winners struck when backtracking, showing spectacular balance on the move, as he anticipated and connected with the shuttle early. From 12-12, he was snapping at Lu’s heels, though the Chinese defense wasn’t wilting till 18-18.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLu had wins over Lee Zii Jia, Anthony Ginting and Jonatan Christie this month. But at this point, Kiran pushed the fourth gear, and didn’t take his foot off the pedal, slashing down three straight points, for a gutsy win on a day when Lakshya Sen and Priyanshu Rajawat faded off in straight sets.\nAt Istora in Jakarta by Thursday, Kiran had played 4 matches including qualifying rounds, in 72 hours. All of them, three-setters.\nGeorge Thomas who was on the Indian team with Padukone and admired how quietly focussed he would be, was glad Kiran had kept at it, against the big-hitting Chinese. “I’ve watched Prakash train many times, and observed how he was after wins and losses. He wouldn’t even talk around matches. Kiran is very meticulous and focussed, but he needs to keep at it till the end. The tournament is still to be won,” he said.\nPedigree & the punch\nGeorge began playing badminton on outdoor courts in Chengannur village in Alappuzha district of Kerala and was prodigiously talented. Winning straightaway at GV Raja Sports school with his strong speedy hitting, he had moved 100 km to capital Trivandrum, and continued to win, making the national camps at Patiala, where a Chinese coach honed his game ahead of the National title in 1991. His brother Suresh Thomas too played and coached at Regional Sports centre, where Kiran and his elder sibling learnt their early games.\nGeorge was known for his speed. Moving to Bangalore though, Kiran found coaching expertise and grew into a highly skilled stroke player with many variations. His drops and backcourt deception are highly evolved, but the smash kill can take two shots far too many to fetch up. It’s not a scary smash yet, strictly make-do, but Kiran has far too many variations to be tied down. “People say he doesn’t have aggression. And he’s not naturally built, the muscle strength is still not wholly developed. But his strokes are good and he’s very positive. He got a little desperate after losing Thomas Cup trials, but usually he rebounds fast after losses,” his father says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs a former player watching his son get all the technical and financial support, George says Kiran must take the next step. “He’s lucky he’s well supported. I tell him three things – stay focussed till the end, take care of your body and learn to peak for big matches. At this level, everyone has strength and fitness. But the best players know to peak in big moments.”','Technology'),(106,'Sarfaraz and Musheer: Two brothers, 7,625km apart, one scored a century for India A, the other for India colts in U-19 World Cup','Naushad Khan was flooded with congratulatory messages and calls the moment he switched on his phone after landing in Mumbai.

Among the many improvements that have come in his game after he started working with coach Darren Cahill – including an improved serve and better fitness – baseline strategy has been refined more than anything else. The Italian uses his pure shot-making to push opponents into awkward positions and open up the court to put the ball away. His backhand down the line is the most useful option for winners, but his backhand crosscourt is the most useful rally weapon.\nFour superstars. One trophy.

He solved this problem in their next match that he won in the same week, bringing his forehand into play as an attacking strategy, and staying aggressive, not passive, from the baseline.\nThis match may well be defined by how much Djokovic is able to keep Sinner preoccupied on his forehand side, and how often the Serb goes for the gutsier backhand down-the-line as opposed to bashing it out in long crosscourt rallies.\nSeizing key moments\nADVERTISEMENT\nMany aspects of both their playing styles may make this match live up to the hype.

Their inexperience.\nTwo of their three spinners with a combined experience of just one Test before this are not showing sufficient signs of complimenting Jack Leach, whose control alone may not be enough for them to get the job done, particularly on a pitch that is on the slower side. How much their decision to go without a second seamer could cost them only time will tell, but India have, so far, made full use of it.\nHaving restricted England to 246 on what is probably the most batting friendly surface in recent times (barring the one in Ahmedabad against Australia, which played out a draw), India’s response seems to suggest they want to bat just once and big. With 119/1 on board, and still trailing by 127 runs, a big first innings lead, which England cannot swat away quickly, will be India’s primary target on Day 2. If not, there is enough time in the Test for scripting comebacks. While the pitch at Hyderabad was not as hostile as it was in Nagpur, Delhi or Indore last year, in the Australia series, it is expected to undergo wear and tear as the game progresses. Batting last in India, as you would know, comes with its own risk.\nREAD | India vs England 1st Test: How Bazball played out amidst the craft and cunning of India’s spin trio\nAxar Patel, who grabbed two wickets, including a ripper to dismiss Jonny Bairstow, summed up the pitch and outlined India’s plans. “They made 246 and we know that the wicket was good. There is spin but the wicket is slow and we know that we did well to restrict them to 246,” he said. “We will look to bat long and then runs will be taken care of. I don’t think the pitch is having any excessive spin, it’s just normal spin. As I said the pitch is slow and we can adjust to it as the ball is getting slow after pitching. It is a bit challenging as well for the batters but if you bat well then you can make runs here. It is challenging for bowlers as well because the outfield is quick here and you can go for runs if you err in line and length even slightly,” he added.\nPurpose and intent\nIndia’s response has been commendable so far. In the 23 overs they batted, they were all purpose and showed the intent that was needed to make full use of the good work their bowlers put in. With Wood being the lone seamer – Ben Stokes won’t be bowling because he has just recovered from a leg injury – he had to be on the dot and there was no room for error. But a gifted length delivery first up allowed Jaiswal to start with a boundary before he welcomed Tom Hartley to Test cricket with a six wide of long-on.\nHyderabad: India’s captain Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal run between the wickets on the first day of the first cricket test match between India and England, at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, in Hyderabad, Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024.

On such pitches, spells with the new ball tend to make a difference, but Wood – taking the new ball for the first time since 2015 – continued to be wayward, sending an eight-ball over in his second that hardly troubled Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma. As Hartley conceded 13 more of his second over, Ben Stokes would ultimately turn to Leach to find some control as early as the fifth over.\nIt was a fascinating approach from India, who despite wanting to bat long and big, were in the mood to take on the attack. This wasn’t mindless slogging, but a calculative approach, where they targeted the inexperienced spinners, not letting them settle down on a line and length, using the feet when needed to put pressure. The only mistake that India made with the bat was when Rohi tried to dish out the same punishing treatment to Leach, but managed only to mistime it as far as Stokes at mid-on. It led to a few nervy moments with Shubman Gill surviving a close LBW call, as even Jaiswal took pedal off a bit to limit any further damage.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTop Sports News Now\nIndia vs Australia Live Score, U19 World Cup 2024 Final\nIn U-19 cricketers’ journey to WC final, meet those who laid ground for them\nChelsea all at sea: Ponderous Pochettino, misfiring stars despite £1 billion in transfers and clueless American owner\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE\nHaving put early pressure on Hartley and Rehan Ahmed, whose wrist-spin went for 22 runs in three overs, unless England pick early wickets on Day 2, they could well be in for a long day.

It was a day where England’s aggressive approach lived up to its hype until their charismatic captain Ben Stokes (70 off 88) fell as the last wicket.\nA first innings total of 246 is definitely not the most damaging one—India have already sped to 119/1—that the Babzallers had inflicted on the opposition. However, on a turning track, in conditions where their approach was untested against three world-class spinners, it was as enterprising as it was anywhere else. This was not at all a bad beginning, though the challenge would be to prolong it a bit more.\nThis approach of England suited perfectly to the conditions that India threw up. They had more reasons to rely on it, as it gave them the best chance of putting as many runs on board before they were undone by India’s attack. Nothing illustrated it more than the dismissal of Jonny Bairstow. Having built a nice, steady partnership with Joe Root and despite living dangerously on a few occasions, the duo was beginning to concern India when Axar Patel delivered one with Bairstow’s name on it.\nBairstow did everything he had to the one that angled from Axar’s hands. A forward stride, bat placed before the pad, it was the classical stuff. But Axar – who had only picked three wickets in the four Tests against Australia – had found the right pace to bowl on this surface. It landed and spun viciously to hit the top of off. Maybe Bairstow’s forward stride could have been a bit longer. But against India’s spinners. who keep altering their length, moving front and back almost every alternate ball, looking to survive and score runs needs extraordinary application and a bit of luck.\nWhen such deliveries were bound to come all day along, England were not going to just hang in and bat time. With their approach, it made for a contest, with blows being exchanged constantly. Given the inexperience of their spin attack, the only way England could put some sort of pressure on India was to put up a good total. Winning the toss and batting first, they went in pursuit of it. With the early morning moisture making it for a placid track, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett got the day going with a flurry of boundaries.\nThe right-left combination sets the tempo and with nothing alarming on the pitch, they freed their arms when they intended. India’s fielders hardly moved when the ball raced past them. Not once during the new-ball spell of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj did they swing across the line. With good bounce on offer, they played through the line. Even when Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin came on, they didn’t panic. A paddle sweep and a conventional sweep fetched two boundaries for Duckett off Jadeja.\nLow catches, done RIGHT! ✅\nRelive captain @ImRo45 & @mdsirajofficial‘s solid efforts in the field ? ? #TeamIndia | #INDvENG | @IDFCFIRSTBankhttps://t.co/EQApH0673F\n— BCCI (@BCCI) January 25, 2024\nWrestling back control\nFrom there on, Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar took over, keeping the Bazball in check, but giving due respect to it. Having bowled to Duckett without a fielder at cover during the 2016 series, that Ashwin started with one to the left-hander, with protection for a reverse-sweep and a paddle-sweep, showed the well-studied plans of India’s spinners. With a dark dry patch on either side, and the pitch getting baked under the bright sun, they found turn and bounce as Jadeja got rid of Ollie Pope with Rohit Sharma completing a low catch at slips. When Crawley was caught at mid-off off Ashwin, England had lost three wickets in 21 balls.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Bazball is not about scoring 6-7 runs an over, it’s about trying to be the best version of yourself: Dinesh Karthik\nAll eyes were now on how Root and Bairstow would respond. For a side that never seemed to take the pedal off the feet even when wickets fell in a heap previously, here they played the moment, but not once did they drift away from their approach. Be it playing shots or defending, they stuck to their plan, which has worked for them so far.\nGoes to FIFTY with a six! ?\nBatted, @BenStokes38 ?\nMatch Centre: https://t.co/s4XwqqpNlL\n#INDvENG | #EnglandCricket pic.twitter.com/QQt0qcwWiS\n— England Cricket (@englandcricket) January 25, 2024\nAs Dinesh Karthik has told this daily, Bazball’s ethos is not just about aggressive approach, but to do everything you do with absolute conviction. Similar to how India’s spinners gave due respect, the experienced England reciprocated respect to Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar. Of course, they created opportunities to score boundaries, but at the same time they also defended them with confidence, in a bid to alter their plans. From there it became a battle of patience on either side of lunch before Axar found a way to beat Bairstow.\nFrom there on, Stokes took it upon himself after Root fell a couple of overs later, top-edging a sweep off Jadeja to short fine-leg. He is their perennial man for crisis. He is the sort of player whose approach India have been wary of. Capable of riding the storm or counter-attacking his way out of trouble or shielding the tail and single-handedly playing a game-changing knock, Stokes can do it all with aplomb. When Ben Foakes departed with scoreboard reading 137/6 and a long tail to follow, another opposition in India was on the verge of falling way short of a total that could keep them in the game.\n????. ???. ?. ?????! ⚡️ ⚡️@akshar2026 with his first wicket of the match ? ?\nFollow the match ▶️ https://t.co/HGTxXf8b1E#TeamIndia | #INDvENG | @IDFCFIRSTBank pic.twitter.com/liBwODtcrM\n— BCCI (@BCCI) January 25, 2024\nBut Stokes would leave his stamp on the game. With Rehan Ahmed, debutant Tom Hartely and Mark Wood playing their part, Stokes would hang in. He would even let Ahmed and Hartley swing for the trees as he hung on waiting for the moment to unleash. Perhaps he was waiting for the challenge to get even harder. He then switch-hit Jadeja for his first boundary, off the 53rd ball he faced. From there on Stokes clobbered his way to a vital 70 before being undone by a Bumrah’s peach as England had 246 on board which Ashwin thought was 30-40 runs more than India liked.','Sports'),(112,'Australia’s Cameron Green takes field in 2nd Test vs West Indies despite testing Covid positive','Australian allrounder Cameron Green was allowed to take the field despite testing Covid positive for the second Test against West Indies on Thursday.

The ball pitched on the middle stump and turned sharply to hit the top of the off-stump, while the batter was trying to work the ball on the leg side. The ball after pitching fizzed through giving the batter no time to adjust. The speed gun read 95.4 KPH.\n“I think when you are bowling quicker and bowling a good delivery the batter then neither commits forward or back which makes it difficult,” Panesar told The Indian Express. This is where the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been lethal in home conditions. Though there is help from the pitches the Indian trio has been quicker through the air not giving the batters enough time to adjust and then an error in judgment in either picking lines or lengths makes them near impossible to face.\n“You can see that Jadeja always bowls quickly early in his spell to get into his spell and afterwards changes the pace,” said Panesar. In addition to bowling quicker through the air Indian spinners tend to be hitting the stumps consistently. “They are going to bowl wicket-to-wicket. I think 35-40 per cent of the deliveries will hit the wickets,” adds the 41-year-old.\nWhy can’t visiting spinners replicate what Indian spinners do?\nThough there is a blueprint for spinners to bowl when in India, which is to bowl quicker through then reaping rewards has been few and far between. “When they are bowling quicker you lose shape (ability to bowl above the batter’s eye line and creating a doubt if he has to come forward or not) on the ball if you want to bowl quicker you still need to have shape on it.”\nWhen bowling quickly spinners might also lose their accuracy resulting in bowling boundary bowls and not letting the pressure pile on Indian batters hence bowling slower balls is preferable for many spinners as it tends to give more control. “When you bowl a bit slower you can get good shape on the ball.” However, Panesar reckons the problem that it brings is that when the ball is slower, the batter has that extra time to adjust even if he misreads the delivery.\n“Even if you beat them in the air because there is not much pace of the wicket on Indian pitches even if it spins one can adjust,” he says.\nADVERTISEMENT\nREAD | Bazball is not about scoring 6-7 runs an over, it’s about trying to be the best version of yourself: Dinesh Karthik\nRishabh Pant’s 91 in the first Test in Chennai 2021 though in a losing cause typified the approach the Indian batters tend to take against the visiting spinners. While there was rough outside the off-stump of the left-hander, every time Jack Leach tried to land the ball on the spot Pant would dance the track and hit him for a maximum not letting the spinner settle down. “Thought I was playing in the IPL!” Leach hilariously said at the time. “As a spinner, you have to expect that at times. But I’m never going to enjoy 8 overs for 80,” he added.\nPanesar believes that the aggression shown by Indian batters tends to put a lot of pressure on spinners. “They don’t want the spinners to bowl with a good shape on it, good dip, good drop. That’s the danger ball for the Indian batters. So they will come after you so that you fire it in, just bowl into the pitch and don’t put that shape on it. And it is easier to pick the length and then they will milk you all day.”\nREAD | India vs England: Can Gill and Iyer fill the Virat-void?\nCreative fieldsets\nKevin Pietersen’s 186 in Mumbai is arguably one of the best counter-attacking innings a visiting batter has played on Indian soil. The batter made 338 runs at an average of 48.29 back then. While he was looking to take on the spinners, the inexperience of Ashwin and tired legs of Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha had no answer to the assault throughout the series.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFast forward over a decade, there has been significant change. Joe Root is technically one of the sound batters against spin bowling. He can rotate the strike at will and can bring out the sweep shot and make the bowlers re-think their strategy and not let the bowlers settle down. When he made the magnificent double ton in Chennai, his method worked like a well-oiled machine. However, post that the batter was not allowed to sweep at all. “The sweep shot is a lot easier when the spinner bowls it a bit slower. Cause when you bowl slower you can reach out for the ball,” Panesar would theorize.\n“They are also very creative Ashwin and Jadeja are always changing the fieldsets. They always have different tactics and different game plans so that the batters cannot settle,” the former England spinner said.','Technology'),(114,'Australian Open: Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden storm into final with hard-fought win','Rohan Bopanna entered the final of the Australian Open to move within one victory of claiming his maiden men’s doubles title at a Grand Slam.

Mostly, only the back-ups turn up, more in the hope of an opportunity opening up at the last minute.\nBut few batsmen in India’s line-up, weakened by the absence of Virat Kohli, would be as under pressure as Gill could be. So he slogged for a good couple of hours in the nets under the unusually searing January sun. After starting off against seamers, he quickly shifted to facing the spinners (all net bowlers). Having struggled in the past against off-spinners, he would seek one out and instruct him to bowl a bit slower through the air as he alternated between attack and defence. There were times when he was beaten on the outside edge.

Since Alastair Cook’s England rallied to defeat them 2-1 in a four-match series, India have won 16 on the bounce – a feat that not even the all-conquering West Indies and Australia sides of the past – could come close. For 12 years, with a core of their XI remaining intact, they have looked truly invincible, having lost only three Tests at home. Beginning with Michael Clarke in 2013 to Pat Cummins in 2023, 14 captains have made attempts to win a series here. And among them only Steve Smith, Joe Root and Cummins have at least managed to win a Test here.\nAs the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India. Like in 2012, when Andy Flower and Cook masterminded a sensational series win, defeating the hosts in their own game, India are a team in transition. And for the first two Tests in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, they will also be without Virat Kohli, meaning they will have the combined experience of their No 3, 4, 5, 6 will be only 86 Tests. And making it the most complicated for them is the Bazball approach from England, which is making them ponder over a lot.\nWhile India have mostly preferred to play on turners since the World Test Championship came into picture, ahead of the England series there is an element of doubt if they stick to the same formula. Under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, England have binned all conventions associated with Test cricket. The concept of following something just because it has been the norm before doesn’t exist in the Bazball universe.\nDespite breaking barriers, there are already questions flying from all directions in the Old Blighty if England are stretching it too far. For a series of this significance, they landed in India only on Sunday night and have just three training sessions before they take the field in Hyderabad. In Bazball universe, all the preparations for a gruelling India tour happened at Abu Dhabi from mid-January.\nThere is a rationale, not just bravado behind it. They feared that India might serve batting tracks with a second-string attack against them in practice games. And even if there was a turning track, it’s said that they feared the scenario where batsmen get out cheaply without facing many balls and are mopping around on the field without much practice. Instead, in Abu Dhabi, they have gone about training on custom-made tracks, working on a batting routine they hope to adopt in the Tests.\nPlenty of questions for India\nIn the 24 matches since McCullum took over and has redefined how England play Test cricket, they have an overall strike-rate of 75.48 with the bat. In the same period, India’s is 54.57 and Australia 54.14.\nThis approach, where England’s batting unit never takes the pedal off, has put opposition bowlers off guard. The noise and buzz around it only adds to their aura. From having just one win out of 17 before McCullum and Stokes took charge, they have now won 13 in the next 18, including three in Pakistan and one in New Zealand. So this isn’t confined to home. Of course, the upcoming five in India will be a stern test, especially in conditions where the Bazball is yet to be tested.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd it is this unknown element that is making India fret a bit. They are blinded as to what to expect and are huddled in conversations. All things point to India playing on a turner in Hyderabad, but it is understood that this could well turn into a series where the hosts will take stock match after match. While India will heavily rely on the spin trio of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, unlike the past there are deliberations if playing on turners could close the gap between the two sides, especially given India’s brittle middle-order.\nOn turning pitches, apart from toss becoming a crucial factor, it is one quick-fire innings from a batsman that has proved to be a big difference. It is the approach that even India’s batsmen are known to take on such conditions before they rely on the trio of spinners to do their job with the bat. However, with this high-risk game being England’s bread and butter, with their No 1 to No 11 following it to the T, there is more reason to be fearful of this approach as the game could unravel far more quickly than India have experienced at home.\n  View this post on Instagram\n  A post shared by We Are England Cricket (@englandcricket)\n//www.instagram.com/embed.js\nWith all the venues having black soil pitches, for now India believe the lack of bounce and pace off the pitch could keep England’s batting in check. Such tracks where the batting unit have to force the pace could also unsettle England’s plans of playing taller batsmen – long reach against spinners – to an extent.\nThere were even deliberations whether India should go back to their traditional flat decks, which they used to great success during the 2016/17 season where they defeated New Zealand, England and Australia. But even that comes with its own risk element, especially with Bazball. Apart from toss being a factor as batting last on a deteriorating surface could be quite risky, the Bazball has thrived especially in such conditions. Even back home in England, they have moved on from playing on green tracks, instead opting for flat decks that suit England’s stroke-makers.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I don’t really relate to the term Bazball,” Jasprit Bumrah would tell Guardian. “But they are playing successful cricket and the aggressive route of taking the opposition on, showing the world there’s another way to play Test cricket. As a bowler, what I think is that it keeps me in play. And if they’re going for it, playing so fast, they won’t tire me out, I could get heaps [of wickets]. I always think about how I can use things to my advantage. Kudos to them but, as a bowler, you’re in the game.” Well, that’s one way to look at it, but there are concerns for India.\nThat they are facing their biggest ever test in over a decade without their best batsman makes it all the more interesting. Of course, given the calibre of India’s spinners which also includes Kuldeep Yadav, there is still every reason to believe they can extend their unbeaten streak at home. That Australia managed to keep the Bazball in check until Nathan Lyon was around at the Ashes last year would make India all the more hopeful, provided their batting unit steps up without their best Test batsman.','Sports'),(147,'‘Didn’t get a good response… it triggered the whole team’: Jasprit Bumrah opens up on incident with James Anderson','With the Indian cricket team taking on England in a five-Test series starting later this week, Jasprit Bumrah has opened up on the infamous 10-ball over he bowled to James Anderson in the Lord’s Test in 2021, a moment that lit a spark for the rest of the series.\nBesides bowling four no balls in the over, Bumrah had targetted Anderson with a barrage of bouncers, hitting the tailender on the helmet, ribcage and his left hand.','Sports'),(148,'Ranji Trophy: Fog, harsh winter playing spoilsport in North India','The Hostel Ground in Jammu hosted two games in the ongoing Ranji Trophy.

But how do these E Ink displays actually work, and what makes them different from your phone or laptop screen? We unlock the science behind these ingenious displays and explore why E Ink still hasn’t conquered all our screens despite its advantages.\nWhat are E Ink displays and how do they work?\nE Ink displays are a special type of screen technology often used in e-readers like the Amazon Kindle. The technology was originally developed in the 1990s at MIT and is now owned by E Ink Corporation.\nThe screens work using tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black ones suspended in fluid inside the display. By applying positive or negative electrical charges to different areas of the screen, the white or black particles can be made to rise to the surface, creating the text and images on the display.\nHow E Ink works. (Image: E Ink Holdings)\nUnlike LCD and LED displays that use a backlight, E Ink displays reflect light – just like paper. This makes them easier on the eyes for long reading sessions. They also require very little power since they don’t need a backlight and only use energy when the image changes. The lack of backlighting also means that they are easier to read under brighter lighting conditions, which isn’t the case with LCD/LED displays at all – legibility actually takes a hit under bright sunlight.\nHow is E Ink different from E Paper?\nE Ink and E Paper may sound like the same thing, but they actually refer to different display technologies. E Paper is a broad term for any display designed to mimic the appearance of real paper. Meanwhile, E Ink is a specific type of E Paper display that uses millions of tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid.\nSince E Ink displays are not backlit, they may feature LEDs around the display to help you read in the dark. (Image: Amazon)\nAn excellent example of a device with an E Paper display but not an E Ink display is the Pebble smartwatch. This cool gadget uses a low-power LCD with a reflective layer to look like paper, which is a very different implementation from E Ink.\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of E Ink displays?\nE Ink displays have several key advantages that make them well-suited for certain applications. First, they consume very little power compared to LCD and OLED displays. An E Ink display only draws power when the image is changed, meaning it can display a static image for weeks or months without needing a charge. This makes it ideal for e-readers and other devices meant for long battery life.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecond, E Ink displays cause less eye strain for the user. The lack of a backlight and the paper-like visual experience mean users can read on an E Ink device for hours without fatigue. The matte surface and high contrast also make them easily readable outdoors and under bright light.\nAn electronic shelf label. (Image: E Ink Holdings)\nHowever, E Ink displays also have some downsides. The biggest is their slow refresh rate compared to LCD and OLED displays. While improvements have been made, such Ink displays still take much longer to refresh, making them unsuitable for video or animation. E Ink also has limitations on colour and resolution compared to other display technologies. And the niche nature of E Ink manufacturing means the displays remain expensive, especially in larger sizes. This limits their use to mostly e-readers and a handful of other products where their particular advantages outweigh higher cost.\nTherefore, for the majority of display applications demanding speed, responsiveness and high resolution, LCDs and OLEDs remain superior to E Ink alternatives. But for a subset of use cases valuing long battery life, outdoor visibility and eye comfort, they retain unique benefits over other display tech.\nWhat are the uses of E Ink displays?\nE Ink first hit the scene in the early 2000s and was all the rage among e-readers like the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and Sony Reader. Folks loved it because the text was super clear even in bright sunlight. You can still find E Ink displays on Kindle and Kobo e-readers today, though other screen tech has taken over much of the e-reader market.\nADVERTISEMENT\nE Ink made brief appearances in a few early cell phones before getting replaced by fancier displays. But with its easy reading and lower distraction factor, some startups are exploring E Ink in smartphones. A cool example is the BlackBerry-like Minimal Phone, currently crowdfunding, which aims to cut down screen time and help users focus on communication and productivity.\nA wayfinder with an E Ink display. (Image: GDS blog)\nBeyond mobile devices, E Ink is popping up around a few cities on stuff like bus stop displays and walking direction signs. Some restaurants are using E Ink menu boards too. Unlike glossy LCDs that create glare and reflections, such displays feature a matte surface that’s more natural-looking and readable at angles and under different lighting.','Technology'),(152,'Reddit is free education: 9 subreddits that can be your best teachers','Education is the key to success, it not only leads to rewarding careers but influences various aspects of our lives.

Leaks suggest larger 8″ screen for next-gen console','Rumours are heating up that Nintendo may unveil a successor to its popular Switch console later this year. According to a new prediction by Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase, the so-called “Nintendo Switch 2” could launch in 2024 with an 8-inch LCD screen, representing a sizable increase over the 6.2-inch and 7-inch displays found on the original Switch and Switch OLED models respectively.\nHayase based his forecast on supply chain research focused on small and medium sized displays. He believes demand from Nintendo for larger screens suitable for a Switch successor will cause shipments of amusement displays to double next year.\nNeither Nintendo nor its partners have officially confirmed the existence of a Switch 2. However, Bloomberg has reported that Hayase is not alone in predicting an upgraded Nintendo console to hit shelves in 2024.\nSpeculation around a new Nintendo platform has swirled for many months, with signs pointing to its unveiling this year. There are reports that Nintendo privately showcased the Switch 2 to developers at Gamescom 2023.\nDetails on the Switch 2’s technical specifications remain uncertain and conflicting. Some leaks point to a new Nvidia Tegra processor, while others expect Nintendo to use an 8nm chipset from Samsung rather than a 5nm node.\nThe Switch 2 is expected to support 4K visuals and run at 60 frames per second, a significant boost over the original Switch’s max 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second target. Breath of the Wild 2 and tech demos based on Unreal Engine 5 are rumoured to have already been tested on prototype Switch 2 developer hardware.\nOf course, fans eagerly awaiting the next generation of Nintendo gaming will have to wait for official word direct from Nintendo before getting too excited. But analysts clearly believe the company is poised to capitalise on the original Switch’s success with new hardware in 2024.','Technology'),(154,'Epic’s Fortnite and new browser engines show cracks in Apple’s walled garden','Apple is continuing to open up iOS to comply with new regulations from the European Union. Not only is the company enabling alternate browser engines on iOS for the first time ever, but Epic Games has also announced the eventual return of Fortnite to the platform.\nEpic Games revealed it plans to launch the Epic Games Store on iOS devices and bring Fortnite back to the platform later this year, but only in Europe. Fortnite has been unavailable on iOS since 2020 when it was banned for violating App Store policies around in-app purchases.\nThe return of Fortnite marks a major shift for Apple’s traditionally closed ecosystem. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney described Apple’s new rules allowing third-party app stores as “hot garbage” but said the company will take advantage of them regardless.\nThe rules stem from the EU’s Digital Markets Act intended to rein in anti-competitive behavior from major tech companies like Apple. Part of the regulations require that users have the ability to uninstall pre-installed apps like Safari.\nComplementing this change, iOS 17.4 will for the first time allow alternate browser engines beyond just Apple’s own WebKit. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge have historically been forced to run on WebKit for iOS due to Apple’s restrictions.\nNow, with iOS 17.4 which rolls out next month, developers can apply to use alternate engines like Chromium and Gecko. This will enable full functionality and extension support for third-party browsers available on iOS in Europe.\nBoth these developments represent a blow to the walls of Apple’s walled garden. While falling short of fully opening iOS, they demonstrate Apple bending its strict App Store policies in order to comply with the DMA.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe DMA aims to give users more choice over their devices and create a more level playing field between Apple and small developers. Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney said these goals are undermined by the restrictions Apple still has in place like its commission on in-app purchases.\nNonetheless, the return of Fortnite and availability of alternate browsers are milestones in increased competition on iOS. It remains to be seen whether Apple will expand these allowances globally in the face of similar regulatory pressure elsewhere. For now, European iOS users will enjoy options long desired but forbidden by Apple’s tight control over its ecosystem.','Technology'),(155,'Hubble finds water vapour on small exoplanet in landmark discovery','Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to find evidence of water vapour in the atmosphere of the planet GJ 9827d. Even though the planet is twice as wide as the Earth, it is the smallest exoplanet where astronomers have found evidence of water so far.\nThe Max Planck Institute for Astronomy announced the discovery on Thursday. “This would be the first time that we can directly show through atmospheric detection, that these planets with water-rich atmospheres can actually exist around other stars. This is an important step toward determining the prevalence and diversity of atmospheres on rocky planets,” said research team member Björn Benneke in a press statement.\nBut before you jump the gun and imagine the possibility of life on the planet, do note that it is as hot as Venus, which will make a Delhi summer pale in comparison. What is important about the discovery is that the aging Hubble was used to determine the presence of water on such a (relatively) small exoplanet, opening up many new avenues for scientists.\nBut on the other hand, it is still too early for the scientists to conclude whether Hubble measured a small amount of water vapour on a planet with a puffy hydrogen-rick atmosphere or if the atmosphere itself is mostly made of water that was left behind a primeval hydrogen/helium atmosphere that evaporated in the intense radiation of a star.\nBut since the planet is around six billion years old and so close to its host star, scientists are leaning towards the latter possibility since it should have lost most of its primordial hydrogen due to stellar radiation.\nIn the end, the research team is left with two possibilities — either the planet is still clinging to its hydrogen-rich atmosphere, which will make it a mini-Neptune; or it is a warmer version of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which has twice as much water as our planet under its crust.','Technology'),(156,'James Webb Space Telescope takes stunning image of stars being born','The James Webb Space Telescope took this stunning image of a star-forming nebula called N79, which is a region of ionised interstellar atomic hydrogen. The nebula is in the H II region of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and was captured by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).\nN79 is simply a humongous star-forming celestial region that spans around 1,630 light-years and is in the southwest region of LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). It is regarded as the younger version of the Tarantula Nebula (officially known as 30 Doradus). However, scientists estimate that N79 has a star formation efficiency that far exceeds the Tarantula Nebula.\nThis image, in particular, focuses on one of three giant molecular clouds complex called N79 South or S1. The star-shaped pattern that you can see here is a series of diffraction spikes. Just like most other telescopes, Webb uses a mirror to collect light. The design of the mirror on the telescope causes this artifact.\nThe six largest “star spikes” that you can see in the image are caused by the hexagonal symmetry of the Webb telescope’s 18 primary mirror segments. These sorts of patterns are usually most visible around very bright and compact objects where a lot of light comes from the same place. Even though most galaxies appear very small to our eyes, they are much more spread out than a single star and thus do not cause this pattern.\nThis particular image centres on one of the three giant molecular cloud complexes, dubbed N79 South (S1 for short). The distinct ‘starburst’ pattern surrounding this bright object is a series of diffraction spikes. All telescopes that use a mirror to collect light, as Webb does, have this form of artifact that arises from the design of the telescope. In Webb’s case, the six largest starburst spikes appear because of the hexagonal symmetry of Webb’s 18 primary mirror segments. Patterns like these are only noticeable around very bright, compact objects, where all the light comes from the same place. Most galaxies, even though they appear very small to our eyes, are darker and more spread out than a single star, and therefore do not show this pattern.','Technology'),(157,'OpenAI fixes ‘lazy’ GPT-4 Turbo model and drops pricing','OpenAI has released several updates to its AI models and pricing, marking the latest in a series of incremental improvements by the research company.

This model powers applications like ChatGPT and serves as an industry benchmark for conversational AI. Lower prices make the API more accessible for developers building text-intensive products that require analysing documents or books. With open-source models catching up to OpenAI, reduced pricing helps retain customers.\nGPT-3.5 Turbo also gains a new version 0125 with unspecified “improvements.” Since the last iteration was 0613, some may have expected more details on advancements from OpenAI.\nFor GPT-4 Turbo, a new preview model 0125 arrives that OpenAI says “completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly” to reduce “laziness” where the model avoids finishing work. This fix aims to boost performance on technical tasks compared to previous versions. GPT-4 with vision capabilities remains in preview but will launch more broadly in coming months.\nOn the technical side, upgraded text embedding models provide better semantic representations of language for researchers and engineers.\nWhile not earth-shattering, OpenAI’s latest tweaks reflect the company’s iterative approach to enhancing its AI lineup.','Technology'),(158,'Road ends for NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter due to rotor damage','NASA on Thursday said its history-making Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s mission has come to an end after its rotor blades took on damage during landing.

Known as Lumiere, the latest offering from Google is a text-to-video and image-to-video model. In simple words, you input text or image and the AI neural networks translate it into a video. Based on recent reports, Lumiere is much beyond the simple text-to-video functionality.\nThe tool allows users to animate existing images, and create videos in the format of an input image or painting. It also allows video in painting and creating specific animation in sections within an image.\nHow does Lumiere create videos?\nGoogle’s research titled ‘Lumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation’ offers the scientific details behind Lumiere. “We introduce Lumiere – a text-to-video diffusion model designed for synthesizing videos that portray realistic, diverse, and coherent motion – a pivotal challenge in video synthesis. To this end, we introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model,” reads the opening lines of the abstract.\nICYMI | Best AI tools of 2023: ChatGPT rules the roost, followed by Google Bard, Midjourney, and more\nThe main innovation here is the SpaceTime Diffusion model that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once. In contrast, existing AI video models synthesize distant key frames one at a time. With Lumiere, Google aims to offer global temporal consistency ensuring coherent representation across different frames.\nIn the research paper, the capabilities of Lumiere have been demonstrated through various examples. Based on the output, the text-to-video results show some promising consistency and accuracy in portraying diverse scenes. Meanwhile, the image-to-video transformations too seem to show impressive animations. Further, the model’s stylised generation using reference images also produces visually appealing and coherent results.\nLumiere text-to-video demo as cited in the research paper.\nAccording to the researchers, the text-to-video generation framework has been introduced using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion. Since existing methods were struggling with globally coherent motion, the team addressed this by deploying a space-time U-Net architecture that directly generates full-frame-rate video clips, incorporating spatial and temporal modules. Resultantly, their approach showed superior results in image-to-video, video inpainting, and stylised generation.\nAlso Read | DALL-E 3 magic: 13 prompts to craft mind-blowing images for free using Bing Image Creator\nThe team in their conclusion acknowledged this limitation and encouraged future research in this direction. Although their model relies on pixel-space T2I models, the design principles can inspire advancements in latent video diffusion models.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhy does it matter?\nIn the paper, the team compares the performance of the AI model with other state-of-the-art models in the industry that are known for their superior performance in text-to-video and image-to-video generation. Based on the results, Lumiere seems to outperform in terms of video quality as well as text alignment.\nWhile this model may create a buzz with its incredible capabilities, its potential use case could essentially be enabling individuals to create Hollywood-style slick movies with ease. The AI community has been exploring how these models could generate images and videos and the development of world models for advanced simulations. Lumiere seems to be paving way for more advancements and research. It is a significant leap in AI-driven video synthesis, offering vast creative possibilities. The consistent and realistic results displayed in the examples indicate the potential for transformative advancements in the field of AI-generated content.\nIn conclusion, the team stated that their primary goal in this work is to enable novice users to generate visual content creatively and flexibly. They admitted that there is a risk of misuse for creating fake or harmful content with this new technology. “We believe that it is crucial to develop and apply tools for detecting biases and malicious use cases to ensure safe and fair use,” read the research paper.\nIt needs to be noted that as of now, there is no way to access or download Lumiere. However, experts feel that Lumiere will enhance Google Bard’s multimodal capabilities in the future. There is so far no official acknowledgment that the AI model will be integrated into Bard.','Sports'),(162,'Microsoft to lay off 1,900 staff from gaming division, CEO Phil Spencer calls it painful','It seems there will not be any respite for tech professionals anytime soon, as layoffs continue unabated.

One of the key new features is ‘Stolen Device Protection’, which adds extra security measures to protect users’ data if their phone gets stolen. This should be high on every iPhone user’s list to enable, as it better protects your information without any effort on your part.\nWhen you turn on Stolen Device Protection, your iPhone will put limits on certain settings changes when it’s not in a familiar location like your home or workplace.

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence in recent times have accelerated the integration and deployment of AI. Numerous companies around the world have integrated AI into their robots that have been developed for various use cases. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, who is a vocal proponent of AI, took to his blog to share his thoughts about the advancements in robotics technology.\nIn his post, Gates expressed his excitement about the rapid progress in robotics technology and the potential for robots to transform how we live and work. While the billionaire outlined some limitations, he also stated that the innovations in AI are enabling them to demonstrate human-like capabilities in domains such as learning, understanding, and thinking.\nThe 68-year-old believes that robots can undertake dangerous and unfulfilling jobs, making people safer, healthier, and more productive. He went on to highlight some of the robotics companies that are at the forefront of developing humanoid robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. He also sees the possibility for robots to be active in healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and even in homes in the future.\nOn robots taking jobs\nGates acknowledged the fear of robots taking over jobs; however, he feels that governments and the private sector will need to help people brave this transition.\nAlso Read | Bill Gates feels Generative AI has plateaued, says GPT-5 will not be any better\n“I understand concerns about robots taking people’s jobs, an unfortunate consequence of almost every new innovation—including the internet, which (for example) turned everyone into a travel agent and eliminated much of the vacation-planning industry. If robots have a similar impact on employment, governments and the private sector will have to help people navigate the transition,” he wrote.\nThe billionaire said that considering the shortages in the economy and the dangerous and unrewarding nature of certain jobs, robots are unlikely to take jobs that we love, and more likely, they will take over jobs that people are unwilling to do. “I believe it’s less likely that robots will replace us in jobs we love and more likely that they’ll do work people don’t want to be doing. In the process, they can make us safer, healthier, more productive, and even less lonely.”\nThe limitless possibilities\nWhen it comes to robotics, Gates feels if the technology is used the right way, there would be limitless use cases. According to Gates, robots can help during natural disasters where first responders would have to risk their lives or during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic when human interactions may spread the disease further. Robotics can help in manually pulling out weeds from farms instead of toxic chemical herbicides. They can also help move massive loads on factory floors. They can also be beneficial in prosthetics.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Bill Gates believes a 3-day work week is possible, foresees a future with more leisure time for humans\nGates went on to list some of the robotics companies that are doing something remarkable. In Agriculture, Tevel’s fruit-picking robots can work round the clock to address labour shortages and prevent crop wastage. Similarly, Apptronik is developing general-purpose humanoid robots that can be programmed to do various tasks. UCLA’s RoMeLa lab has developed ARTEMIS, one of the world’s fastest-running robots. Startups like Field AI are focused on developing AI software to improve robots’ perception, navigation, and communication abilities.\nGates, who frequently shares his thoughts on AI, had, in a recent interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that generative AI had plateaued and that GPT-5 will not be much different. In the same interview, the Microsoft co-founder also predicted that in the next two to five years, the accuracy of AI software will witness a considerable increase along with a cost reduction. This will lead to the creation of new and reliable applications.','Technology'),(171,'The Wolf Moon falls on Republic Day Eve this year: How to watch','This year’s first full moon is called the Wolf Moon, named after howling wolves, and it is happening on Thursday night.\nThe full moons that happen through the year are sometimes given names like “Wolf Moon,” based on the months and seasons they happen during.

But a new crowdfunded phone called the Minimal Phone is going back to basics with a throwback design featuring a physical keyboard and black and white E Ink display.\nMinimal Phone is the creation of Minimal Company, which plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign in early February to manufacture at least 3,000 units. The company says the phone’s final design is complete and aims to ship the device later this year if funding goals are met.\nThis isn’t your typical smartphone. Instead of a bright LCD or OLED screen, Minimal Phone uses a power-friendly monochrome E Ink display like you’d find on an e-reader. This provides easy outdoor readability and uses less electricity, allowing the phone’s 4,000 mAh battery to last up to 4 days on a charge according to Minimal Company.\nThe Minimal Phone running MinimalOS. (Image: Minimal)\nThe tradeoff is that an E Ink display isn’t ideal for video or motion-heavy games. It’s not like you’ll not be able to play those at all, but the display technology is definitely not suited for such use. However, for those looking to minimize distractions and focus on communication and productivity probably wouldn’t need support for it anyway. The Minimal Phone is meant to offer digital detox while still providing smartphone capabilities, after all.\nDespite the minimalist aesthetic, founder Andre Youkhana says the phone will have modern features like a touch-enabled E Ink screen, camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, global cellular connectivity, and Android OS with Google Play support. The company is also exploring 5G capabilities.\nAt 120 x 72 x 10mm, the phone has a compact form factor reminiscent of older BlackBerry designs thanks to its full QWERTY keyboard. This physical keyboard complements the E Ink display for efficient typing and messaging.\nMinimal Phone’s pared-down MinimalOS comes preloaded with a curated set of apps focused on productivity and privacy. With prices starting around $400 (Rs 33,250), it aims to provide core smartphone functionality at an affordable price point for the niche audience seeking a simpler mobile experience.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThat said, the Kickstarter launch will determine if there’s enough interest to put the Minimal Phone into production. There’s even a chance it may never go into production at all if the funding needs aren’t met or an unexpected snag gets in the way – but we’re hoping it all goes smoothly.','Technology'),(175,'Tech News Today: Google Pixel 8a leaks, Windows Sticky Notes app update and more','Microsoft’s Sticky Notes app for Windows is getting a new update after almost four years.

Starliner went through a successful drop test earlier this month. Teams from NASA and Boeing are conducting the final analysis of the data to complete overall system certification ahead of its first crewed flight.\nNASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 to develop crew transport systems to carry astronauts into space. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract, while SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion. Elon Musk-led SpaceX completed its first crewed flight in 2020, and it has carried more than a dozen crewed flights to the space station since then, along with many cargo flights.

Musk said it would take “a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology” required – a sign that any boost to Tesla’s declining pace of growth would take time.\nHis projection followed a Reuters story earlier in the day saying Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for a June 2025 startup of a smaller crossover vehicle, critical for the automaker as it loses share to inexpensive EVs such as those made by China’s BYD.\n“I’m often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in the second half,” Musk told analysts on a post-earnings call.\nAlso Read | What are smart rings and should you pick one over a fitness tracker?\n“We’ll be sleeping on the line practically,” he said, referring to Tesla’s factory in Texas, where the new model will be first produced. That will be followed by Mexico and another factory outside North America to be decided later this year, he said.\nThe EV maker also warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.\nTesla said it was in between two growth waves: one driven by the release of Models 3 and Y in 2017 and 2020, respectively, and a second wave that would start with the next-generation vehicle platform.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWall Street expects Tesla to sell 2.2 million vehicles this year, according to Visible Alpha. That would be up about 21% from 2023 but well below the long-term target of 50% that Musk set about three years ago. Tesla, however, did not reiterate that target on Wednesday.\nAfter years of breakneck growth, Tesla is bracing for slowing growth and margins as EV demand softens and competition intensifies.\n“If volume’s going to be lower, then my guess is, Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at shareholder Hodges Capital Management.\nCost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in the fourth quarter, but Tesla cautioned it was approaching “the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup,” underscoring the pressure on the company to launch its new lower-cost vehicles. BYD sold more EVs globally than Tesla in the fourth quarter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMusk said Chinese automakers will have significant success outside of China. “If there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”\nTesla reported a gross margin of 17.6% for the three months ended December, compared with 23.8% a year earlier, and analysts’ average estimate of 18.3%, according to LSEG data.\nAutomotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits – a closely watched figure – dropped to 17.2% from 24.3% a year earlier, although it improved from 16.3% in the third quarter.\n“Today’s flat sales and substantially reduced margin results are further evidence that Tesla is losing its leadership advantage and its brand leadership has weakened,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlso Read | Spotify to start in-app purchases on iPhone in Europe after DMA takes effect\nMORE PRICE CUTS?\nTesla slashed prices of its cars since late 2022, igniting a price war that singed U.S. rivals including Ford, who have all slowed EV production.\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla’s margins will depend on how fast interest rates fall.\nIts stock, which has enjoyed valuations of a technology company partly due to Musk’s promise of self-driving cars, has fallen 16% so far this year, after doubling in 2023\n“I don’t think the price cuts are over, mainly for the reason that demand for its electric vehicles is still weak,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNet income more than doubled from the previous year to $7.9 billion, including a $5.9 billion noncash gain related to deferred tax assets. Tesla said lower raw material costs and U.S. government credits helped lower cost-per-vehicle, but Cybertruck production and AI and other research projects increased costs.\nOn an adjusted basis, Tesla earned 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter, missing an average analysts’ estimate of 74 cents, according to LSEG data.\nTesla’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 3% to $25.17 billion, which marked its slowest pace of growth in more than three years.

But what exactly are AI PCs and how critical will they be for the future of personal computing? According to Arnold Su, vice president of consumer and gaming PCs at Asus India, AI PCs are the new cutting edge but will become standard in the next 5-10 years.\n“From a business perspective, what we are looking at AI PCs is similar to the evolution of smartphones 10-12 years ago. Back then, smartphones were treated as a novelty just like how AI PCs are viewed today. But now, nobody talks about smartphones anymore. They are just phones. Similarly, 5-10 years down the line, AI PCs will just become PCs with AI features being standard,” said Su.\nAsus is already beginning to integrate basic AI capabilities into its laptop lineup. “What you have seen right now and you will see with our upcoming launches is, we have enhanced our camera technologies and we’ve also enhanced our noise cancellation capabilities. The integration of all these systems we have started in 2021 itself and now with the new chips and new applications building in, we will continue to enhance the customer experience from that. And going forward, you will have more stuff to look forward to,” noted Su.\nThe ‘AI PC’ trend was kicked off earlier this year by Microsoft, which introduced a dedicated ‘Copilot’ key on its PCs. Other brands are expected to follow suit. (Image: Microsoft)\nHowever, Asus’ current AI integration focuses more on things like computer vision and audio processing rather than bleeding-edge generative AI abilities seen in models like ChatGPT. When asked if Asus has any specific plans to build proprietary generative AI tools, Su did not divulge much. “I can’t talk about future plans at the moment, but currently we are working with multiple partners and we look forward to what we can achieve internally and then we’ll bring the best stuff out for the customers,” he hinted.\nWhile the PC market declined in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, Asus India managed to buck the trend and record strong growth. Su believes reaching customers across India through online and offline channels is key to Asus’ success.\n“Because India is such a big country, making every product available is very important. So from the PC market point of view, there are three major verticals in India – online space, large format retailer, and the traditional channel. We make our products available through online platforms, large format retail stores as well as the traditional channel which still accounts for 50% of the market. We have partner shops in over 400 districts currently where customers can experience our laptops first-hand before buying. This experience is critical and sets us apart,” explained Su.\nAsus now has over 250 exclusive stores across India covering 600 out of 750 districts. The goal is to expand to more towns and cities to stay the second-largest PC brand in India.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn Su’s words, “In Q3 2022, Asus became the number two consumer PC brand in India for the first time, overtaking HP. For 2023, we want to secure this second spot. We will continue focusing on bringing the latest tech across India’s towns and cities.”\nThis focus on India is not just lip service but core to Asus’ global market strategy. “India is always the first wave country for any new Asus product launch globally. It is our first priority within the company,” emphasised Su.\nContrary to the belief that entry-level devices drive volumes in India, Su has realised that Indian consumers are willing to spend more for better experiences.\n“Over the years, we’ve seen Indian customers prefer mainstream and premium laptops over entry-level options.
