Nirmala Sitharaman to equal Morarji Desai’s record with her sixth straight budget,"With the presentation of the interim budget on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha, who had presented five budgets in a row.","Sitharaman, the first full-time woman finance minister of the country, has presented five full budgets since July 2019 and will present an interim or vote-on-account budget next week.
With the presentation of the interim budget on February 1, Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha, who had presented five budgets in a row.
Desai, as finance minister, had presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959-1964. The interim budget 2024-25 to be presented by Sitharaman on February 1, will be a vote-on-account that will give the government authority to spend certain sums of money till a new government comes to office after the April-May general elections.

As the Parliamentary elections are due, Sitharaman’s interim budget may not contain any major policy changes. Speaking at an industry event last month, Sitharaman had ruled out any “spectacular announcement” in the interim budget, saying it would just be a vote-on-account before the general elections.
A vote-on-account, once approved by Parliament, will authorise the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India on a pro-rata basis to meet expenditure for the April-July period.
The new government, which is likely to be formed around June, will come up with a final budget for 2024-25 sometime in July. Usually, interim budgets do not contain major policy announcements, but nothing stops the government from taking steps which are necessary to deal with the urgent issues facing the economy.
After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19. It was in 2017, that Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting budget on the last working day of February to 1st of the month.

Piyush Goyal, who was holding the additional charge of the ministry due to ill health of Jaitley, presented the interim budget for 2019-20 on February 1, 2019. Goyal had hiked standard deduction for salaried taxpayers by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. Also, the tax rebate for taxpayers whose annual taxable income did not exceed Rs 5 lakh was increased from Rs 2,500 to Rs 12,500.
After the 2019 general elections, in the Modi 2.0 Government, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio. She became the second woman to have presented a budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71.
That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a ‘bahi-khata’ with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.

Under Sitharaman, India has weathered the Covid pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag of the fastest growing major economy and a ‘bright spot’ in the world economy.
India is racing to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2027-28 and USD 30 trillion by 2047. Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who holds the tag of presenting 10 budgets — the maximum by any finance minister — had presented six of them, including one interim, in a row.
The first budget of Independent India was presented by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.
Sitharaman, who will be presenting her sixth budget in a row, is expected to come up with some measures, especially to boost the rural sector as the agriculture sector growth in 2023-24 is estimated to decelerate to 1.8 per cent, from 4 per cent, in the preceding year.
Rakesh Nangia, Chairman, Nangia Andersen India said given the proximity to the elections, the budget is expected to focus on immediate fiscal needs rather than introducing broad long-term economic reforms.

In the last interim budget for FY 2019-20, while the overall tax structure remained unchanged, there were certain specific tax rebates and standard deduction concessions. “While major announcements may be deferred until after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the budget is expected to address ongoing concerns and lay the foundation for future economic growth. This strategic approach aims to balance immediate fiscal responsibilities with long-term economic objectives in a pre-election context,” Nangia said.

"‘Will densify network, want to be at least no. 2 in any city pair’: Air India Express MD","'In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments—15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international,' says AI Express’s Managing Director Aloke Singh","The merger of Tata group’s budget airlines Air India Express (AI Express) and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) into one carrier — AI Express — is on track for completion in the next three to four months, even as operational integration of the two is nearly complete. According to AI Express’s Managing Director Aloke Singh, the airline in its brand-new avatar aspires to double its market share by 2028, more than triple its fleet size to 180 aircraft, and build a dense network focussed on tier-two and tier-three cities, all while working in synergy with parent Air India to realise the group’s vision of emerging as a formidable player in India and beyond.
In an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Singh gives a lowdown of AI Express’s vision and strategy to chart ambitious growth in the coming years. Edited Excerpts:
How is the integration of AI Express and AIX Connect coming along?
The past year has been all about the integration, which involves integrating systems, processes, platforms, people, brand, networks and fleets. We have tweaked the combined network to facilitate flows between the two networks. That integration is now moving into a merger, which we hope to complete in three to four months. Simultaneously, a massive growth agenda has kicked in. We are now inducting aircraft at a rate of three-and-a-half per month, and it will continue for a while.
ADVERTISEMENT
With steady supply of new aircraft, what shape will your network take?
The new capacity will help us grow significantly. This growth will come from our existing markets as well as some new ones. In our existing markets, we will densify the network and plug gaps that we could not address earlier due to capacity constraints. The broad network strategy is that we will first consolidate our presence and become stronger wherever we already operate. We want to be at least the number two player in any city pair. We don’t want to open too many new stations together. We want to open one station, deploy capacity there to increase connectivity, and spread out from there. As we become firm in a market, it will also help us in rationalising costs.
AI Express was almost exclusively a short-haul international carrier while AIX Connect was a domestic airline. Should we expect the combined entity to be more focussed on the domestic market?
If you put the two networks together, we roughly have 50 per cent capacity each on domestic and international. This will remain so for the next year or two. The domestic portion will then grow to some extent. We will probably end up with about 60 per cent domestic and 40 per cent international. The domestic market is much bigger and our capacity deployment will reflect that.
In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments—15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international.
What is the status of network optimisation at the group level between the full-service carrier (Air India) and the budget carrier (AI Express)?
It has started and will be a continuous process as the nature of markets is dynamic. Route rationalisation at the group level has begun. Different operational models suit different markets. If we see that a market is better served in financial terms by the low-cost model, then we will deploy the relevant product. There will be markets where operating premium products will offer an upside, so the full-service product will be offered there. In markets and segments that are big and deep enough, we would look at straddling both product offerings.
ADVERTISEMENT
 The market sees IndiGo, which has a domestic market share of over 60 per cent, as your biggest competitor. How do you look at that challenge?
The market is big enough and deep enough, and has space for a number of players. The broad thrust of our network strategy will be a lot more focus on tier-two and tier-three cities. We will also focus on international operations from tier-two cities, because that is a space we understand very well. We will not be concentrating our capacity on large cities. Of course, there will be some capacity deployed there, but a large part will be for tier-two, tier-three cities.
So, you are looking at a point-to-point network instead of hub-and-spoke?
Yes, it will not be focussed on a large hub. However, our network will have a number a focus cities, probably 10, where we will also transfer passengers. Like, Kochi may not be a hub per se, but it has significant potential for domestic-to-domestic, international-to-domestic, and even international-to-international transfers. Similarly, we are connecting Bangalore, where we have a dense network, to our points in Kerala. For example, we can offer travel from Ayodhya to Kochi via Bangalore, or a Lucknow-Bangalore-Trivandrum connection.
Air India Express operated Boeing 737s while AIX Connect had Airbus A320s. Do you now plan to operate both or retire the A320s?
We will have a mixed fleet. You have to look at the fleet from the group perspective. The fleet will be fungible. We want that flexibility. Having a mixed fleet may have some sub-optimality, but with scale, fleet commonality benefits diminish. If you have 200 or 300 or 400 aircraft, due to the large scale of operations, a mixed fleet is not too different from a single-type fleet.
ADVERTISEMENT
Our plan is to have a fleet size of about 180 aircraft by 2028. We have a legacy fleet of 26 737NGs (737 Next Generation), of which 10 are leased, and 28 A320s, all of which are leased. The leased aircraft will start going back to lessors starting this year.
The Air India group’s 470-aircraft order includes 190 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Are all of those going to come to Air India Express?
So far, we have not taken that call at the group level. The aircraft deliveries will stretch over years. Some of the Airbus A320s and A321s (also part of the order) may even come our (Air India Express) way. Aircraft type within the group will remain fungible given the long delivery schedule and the decisions will be based on synergies within the group like aircraft engineering and maintenance. But certainly, Air India Express will operate under an all-economy model.
Considering Air India Express has mostly been a short-haul international carrier and given the growth trajectory you are eyeing, are you looking to get into wide-body operations as well?
No, we have no such plans at present. We first want to grow and scale up with our current model (low-cost domestic and short-haul international operations), before thinking about anything else.
By when can we see your legacy fleet in the new Air India Express branding?
We are not going to change the livery on the legacy fleet. One reason is that many of those aircraft will be going back to lessors once the leases expire. Secondly, we want to prioritise the new aircraft, as the painting capacity in the MROs (maintenance, repair, and overhaul units) is limited. We want to paint the new aircraft first and then take a call on the older ones. In any airline’s livery change programme, it takes years for 100 per cent of the aircraft to get rebranded.
Given your thrust on tier-two and tier-three cities, will we see Air India Express applying for routes under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik)?
Certainly, we could look at it, if it fits into our route strategy. We would be really interested in international UDAN, but there could be some domestic routes also that could make sense for us.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/interview-with-aloke-singh-md-air-india-express-9128164/,business

Apart from these 68 planes—part of the Air India group’s mammoth 470-aircraft order placed in 2023—four leased Boeing 777 wide-body planes will also join the carrier’s fleet.
Air India currently has 117 operational aircraft in its fleet, while its arm Air India Express has 63 planes. Under the new owners, Air India has been able to bring back to service 90 per cent of its long-grounded aircraft as well.
Apart from fleet expansion, 2024 will also see Air India kick off the full interior refit of 40 legacy wide-body aircraft—Boeing 777s and 787s. The upgradation exercise, which will include complete replacement of seats and in-flight entertainment system on the legacy wide-body fleet, is expected to start in July, coinciding with Air India’s first A350 aircraft starting international operations. The plane, which started commercial operations this week, is initially flying domestic sectors for a few months for crew familiarisation flights. Air India also plans to start interior upgrades on 41 narrow-body A320 aircraft as well this year.

“Though we still have a long way to go to upgrade the legacy fleet, improve our consistency, close remaining gaps and strengthen fragile processes, the future is now more visible, more tangible and, I hope, more inspiring. Despite—and no doubt somewhat because of—the good progress we’ve made in two short years since privatisation, expectations are high, so we need to keep rising to meet them,” Wilson said.
Over the past two years, Air India has augmented its legacy fleet by taking 36 aircraft on lease, apart from pacing the giant 470-aircraft order with Airbus and Boeing. It has added five domestic and 11 international routes to its network, and opened five new international stations. New brand identities for both Air India and Air India Express were also launched last year.
Ever since Air India returned to the Tata group on January 27, 2022, the new owners have been focusing on sprucing up the product offering, while also planning an extensive expansion for the airline. A five-year roadmap–Vihaan.AI–was prepared with the objective of substantially growing the airline’s network and fleet in a bid to put it on a “path to sustained growth, profitability, and market leadership”.
As per data shared by Wilson with staff, Air India clocked 249 per cent revenue growth over the past two years, while Air India Express’s revenue grew 148 per cent over the period. Wilson did not give further details on the group’s financials.

Red Sea woes: Exporters seek increased credit as freight rates jump 300%,Rising attacks forced shippers to consider the longer route,"Indian exporters have asked the central government to help facilitate more credit as freight rates have jumped nearly 300 per cent due to the disruption in the Red Sea route forcing global shipping lines to take longer trade routes, which is ultimately affecting exports of low value items such as Basmati rice.
Increasing attacks on ships sailing in the Red Sea region since November 2023 have forced shippers to consider the alternative, longer route past the Cape of Good Hope, which has not only stretched delivery time by 15 to 20 days, but also increased the transit cost substantially because of incremental freight rates and insurance premium.
Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai told The Indian Express that freight costs have surged by 300 per cent as global shipping lines are taking the Cape of Good Hope route, which is why exporters have sought more credit to match the rising cost of shipments to Europe.

Meanwhile, ratings agency Crisil on Thursday said that players operating in sectors such as agricultural commodities and marine foods could see a significant impact due to the perishable nature of their goods or lean margin profiles, which limit their ability to absorb the risks from rising freight cost.
“Not all sectors are expected to be impacted to the same extent. In fact, for agricultural commodities like Basmati rice (30-35% of production is shipped to these regions), exporters are feeling the pressure as rising freight cost has curbed exports and a part of their inventory is now being sold in the domestic market, leading to a moderation in realisations,” the report said.
Indian companies use the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, North Africa, and parts of the west Asia. Crisil said that these regions accounted for 50 per cent of India’s exports worth Rs 18 lakh crore and 30 per cent of imports worth Rs 17 lakh crore last fiscal.
“Marine foods –predominantly shrimp and prawn – could also see a significant impact as 80-90 per cent of the production is exported, more than half of it through the Red Sea. Their perishable nature and lean margins make exporters vulnerable to rising freight cost and competitive pressure from Latin American suppliers,” the report added.

The model code of conduct (MCC), likely to be implemented next month, is being viewed as a final cutoff date, with hectic last-minute parleys being escalated to the highest level in the Indian government across ministries including commerce, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs to thrash out a final consensus, a government official said.
The FTA with the UK would be the first full fledged deal with a western country that would see deeper economic integration with a major global service sector leader. However, the window to sign the deal is fast closing with elections in both the countries this year. While the general election in the UK is expected in December this year, India’s general elections are likely to take place between April and May this year.
The UK FTA is crucial as it will serve as a template for trade deals with larger western trade partners such as the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Economic integration with the western countries through FTA assumes significance as the global supply chain is undergoing a reset after covid-19 and multinational companies globally are adopting a China plus one policy. Multilateral trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) are also being negotiated in a bid to shift away from dependence on China.

“For us (India) MCC is the cutoff. Our UK counterpart understands this and that is the reason their officials are here and meetings are ongoing with the highest level of the government across ministries including commerce ministry, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs,” the official said.
A delegation from the UK arrived in India on January 22.
“All chapters are closed but a handful of articles in a few chapters are remaining. It is a small basket now. Over 90 per cent of the deal has been closed. There have been several issues and chapters closed in the last three months,” the official added.
The MCC is a code containing general precepts for model behaviour during elections conducted by Election Commission (EC). It has an entire chapter on what the party in power can and cannot do once elections are announced which forbids use of official machinery and personnel for the political gains of the party in power.

Hence, the spirit of MCC also requires the bureaucracy or any public servant to not engage or appear to engage in an activity that could work to the advantage of the party in power. Notably, the MCC is only a moral code and lacks any statutory backing, the EC, at best, can censure, advise or pull up the person found violating it.
With the date for MCC fast approaching, India is looking to close two other FTAs including the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Free Trade Association with the four nation bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
However, the comprehensive trade deal with Australia is likely to be taken up after the general elections as Australian negotiators are seeking access into India’s agricultural market, which is a sensitive sector for India.

While the UK has asked India to reduce duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. The final deal could see India lower duty to a greater extent as India is a high tariff country. The average tariff on goods imported from India into the UK is 4.2% but the average tariff in India on goods imported from the UK is 14.6%
Negotiations on cars and whisky have been contentious as Indian industry has been seeking greater access into the UK market too. Indian whisky manufacturers have said that the UK should ease its three year maturation rule, which acts as a barrier for Indian whisky brands seeking entry into the UK, and is seeking duty concessions in the auto sector, particularly in the EV segment.
India’s labour-intensive sectors are expected to see gains from the India-UK FTA, especially the textile sector. Indian textile exports face tariffs as high as 10% in the UK and a trade deal could put India on par with competition such as Bangladesh (which get LDC benefits), and revive textile exports. Meanwhile a greater integration in the services sector with the UK could help greater job creation in the fast growing industry.
India and the UK are also looking to sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) alongside the FTA that could improve UK’s investments into India. To resolve investor-state disputes under the new BIT faster, India is expected to move away from its 2016 model BIT approach that stressed on exhaustion of local remedies.
In FY2023, India’s merchandise exports to the UK were valued at $11.41 billion while imports stood at $8.96 billion.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-uk-fta-final-push-for-deal-as-window-closing-fast-9127471/,business
Govt close to saturation in implementing social sector schemes: Nirmala Sitharaman,"Even earlier governments had schemes of providing houses, roads etc but the sense of urgency was missing, she said, adding, nearly 50 per cent of the population were devoid of fundamental things 50 or 60 years post independence.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said the government is close to reaching saturation in implementing social sector schemes designed to provide basic necessities to the poor. Addressing the students of Hindu College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, she said the time has come for India to become economically ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) and march forward to become a developed nation by 2047.
Regretting that 60 years since Independence passed without any sense of urgency, Sitharaman said, “we have laid the material foundation for a Viksit Bharat” and empowering people by providing basic necessities to all.
Even earlier governments had schemes of providing houses, roads etc but the sense of urgency was missing, she said, adding, nearly 50 per cent of the population were devoid of fundamental things 50 or 60 years post independence.

“So that’s the underlying principle with which between 2014 and today we have done with a sense of urgency. Push the border forward, you take it further. Make sure everybody who’s actually eligible to get those should get it…the approach (of the government) is to empower people, skill people, give access and ensure that everyone gets good health treatment and so on,” she said.
She also said the government has been able to save Rs 2.5 lakh crore through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) by weeding out dummy and undesirable beneficiaries.
DBT has not only improved transparency in the government fund transfer but also enhanced efficiency through the use of technology, she said.
Stressing that the government doesn’t differentiate between people, Sitharaman said that is the reason why the prime minister categorises India in four groups–Youth, Women, Farmers and Poor– and efforts are made for betterment of these groups irrespective of caste, creed and religion. She also said that India is nearly self-sufficient as far as agriculture is concerned except in oil seeds and pulses.

However, she advocated that one should not waste food as many parts of the world are facing problems.
Terming Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha ceremony of January 22 as a ‘civilisational marker’, she said, this was a fortunate moment for the generation who could witness restoration of civilisational values. She urged the students to focus on skill development as well as on values — both civilisational and nationalistic.
Reminding students that the country celebrates National Voters’ Day on January 25, she said, it is not just the right of citizens to vote but it is their duty also, and the first-time voters have greater responsibility.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/nirmala-sitharaman-hindu-college-govt-close-to-saturation-social-sector-schemes-dbt-9127304/,business

"Hyundai Motor’s Q4 net profit rises 31%, misses forecasts","Hyundai Motor, the world's No.3 automaker by sales with its affiliate Kia Corp, reported a net profit of 2.2 trillion won ($1.65 billion) for the October-December period versus a profit of 1.7 trillion won a year earlier.","South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co on Thursday reported a 31% rise in fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst expectations due to unfavourable exchange rates as well as one-off costs related to the sale of its Russia plant in December.
Hyundai Motor, the world’s No.3 automaker by sales with its affiliate Kia Corp, reported a net profit of 2.2 trillion won ($1.65 billion) for the October-December period versus a profit of 1.7 trillion won a year earlier.
That compared with a 2.9 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted towards estimates from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

In December, Hyundai Motor said it would take a 287 billion won ($219.2 million) loss on selling its plant in Russia, where operations have been suspended since March 2022.
Hyundai is targeting revenue growth of 4.0%-5.0% this year. It expects a 4.9% jump in North American vehicle sales but a 3.7% drop and 0.6% fall in vehicle sales in China and Europe, respectively. It predicted an operating profit margin between 8.0% and 9.0% in line with last year.
“Hyundai Motor expects the business environment will remain difficult to predict, due to macro uncertainties centered on emerging markets and a downturn in the real economy,” Hyundai Motor said in a statement.
Analysts noted that like other automakers, Hyundai is grappling with slowing growth due to a difficult economic environment, including high interest rates and inflation that have pushed vehicles out of the reach of some buyers.

“It appears that pent-up demand for vehicles from limited supplies has been disappearing as high interest rates eat away car buyers’ willingness to purchase,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.
Lee added that Hyundai Motor would likely manage its vehicle inventory level more tightly than previous years as pent-up demand has disappearing and excessive inventories would hurt its profitability.
Shares in Hyundai Motor were trading up 2.0% after it reported its earnings, outperforming 0.1 rise for the benchmark KOSPI.

Govt permits direct listing by Indian firms on GIFT-IFSC’s international markets,The international stock exchanges at GIFT-IFSC—India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange—are currently prescribed as the permitted stock exchanges.,"The government on Wednesday allowed direct listing of securities by public Indian companies on the international exchanges of GIFT International Financial Services Centre (GIFT-IFSC), and made the requisite provisions to provide “an overarching regulatory framework” to facilitate it. In July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government had decided to enable direct listing of listed and unlisted companies on the IFSC exchanges. The move is expected to give Indian companies access to cheaper foreign capital, boost foreign investment, and broaden investor.
The Department of Economic Affairs of the Finance Ministry has amended Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, and notified the Direct Listing of Equity Shares of Companies Incorporated in India on International Exchanges Scheme. Additionally, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued Companies (Listing of Equity Shares in Permissible Jurisdictions) Rules, 2024.
“These, together, provide an overarching regulatory framework to enable public Indian companies to issue and list their shares in permitted international exchanges. As of now, the framework allows unlisted public Indian companies to list their shares on an international exchange. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is in the process of issuing the operational guidelines for listed public Indian companies,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The international stock exchanges at GIFT-IFSC—India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange—are currently prescribed as the permitted stock exchanges. These exchanges are under the regulatory supervision of the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). GIFT-IFSC is India’s first international financial services centre set up with the objective of connecting India with global opportunities while helping the Indian economy connect with the global financial system and facilitating seamless flow of global capital into India.
“This policy initiative…will reshape the Indian capital market landscape and offers Indian companies, especially start-ups and companies in the sunrise and technology sectors, an alternative avenue to access global capital beyond the domestic exchanges. This is expected to lead to better valuation of Indian companies in line with global standards of scale and performance, boost foreign investment flows, unlock growth opportunities and broaden the investor base,” the Finance Ministry said.
Public Indian companies will have the flexibility to access both markets—domestic for raising capital in rupees and international market at IFSC for raising capital in foreign currency from the global investors.
“This initiative will particularly benefit Indian companies going global and having ambitions to look at opportunities for expanding their presence in other markets. It is also expected to provide a boost to the capital market ecosystem at GIFT IFSC by provision of new investment opportunities for investors, diversification of financial products and by enhancing liquidity,” the ministry said.

According to the government, it is not mandatory for an unlisted company intending to list on international exchanges to also list on domestic exchanges. However, there is no restriction on such companies to opt for listing on domestic as well as international exchanges. The equity shares listed on international exchanges will be counted towards the foreign holding of the company. Also, public companies falling under sectors prohibited for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will not be allowed to issue shares under this scheme.
Indian residents will not be allowed to trade or invest in shares of Indian companies on international exchanges. Non-resident Indians (NRIs), however, will be allowed to trade. Individuals and entities from countries sharing a land border with India will also be allowed to trade, subject to approval from the government.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/govt-permits-direct-listing-by-indian-firms-on-gift-ifscs-international-markets-9126380/,business
Sharing of investor data with SEBI: FPIs get seven months to liquidate their holdings,"“There is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings,” sources said. Sebi had earlier asked FPIs to bring down such exposure by January 29, 2024.","Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) will get seven months to liquidate their holdings if they do not meet the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s January-end deadline to disclose data about their investors, highly-placed sources said.
In August last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had issued a circular which asked high-risk FPIs, holding more than 50 per cent of their equity AUM in a single corporate group or with an overall holding in Indian equity markets of over Rs 25,000 crore, to disclose granular details of all entities holding any ownership, economic interest, or exercising control in the FPI.
“There is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings,” sources said. Sebi had earlier asked FPIs to bring down such exposure by January 29, 2024.

Explained | FPI disclosure norms deadline extended: Why is SEBI seeking investor data?
If FPIs continue to meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of January end, they would have an added 10/30 working days to provide the additional details required, they said. “Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they would have a further 6 months to reduce their holdings,” sources said.
Sources said FPIs which met the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of October 31, 2023 had time till January 2024 end to rebalance their holdings if they so wished.
FPIs had sold stocks worth over Rs 27,000 crore between January 17-23 in the cash market, according to stock exchange data. FPIs have offloaded Rs 19,308 crore of local shares on a net basis in January so far, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL). Net FPI outflows, after accounting for their investments in IPOs and debt market, were Rs 4,439 crore in January.
The Sebi’s circular came into effect on November 1, 2023. According to the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by FPI custodians on additional disclosure norms, existing FPIs, which are in breach of the investment limits as on October 31, 2023, would be required to bring down such exposure within 90 calendar days i.e. January, 29, 2024 (settlement date), unless they fall under any of the exempted categories.

According to sources, FPIs which may be required to provide enhanced disclosures are expected to be significantly less than estimated in the consultation paper and the SEBI board note.
In May, Sebi had said that based on the data as of March 31, 2023, FPI assets under management of around Rs 2.6 lakh crore may potentially be identified as high-risk FPIs who would have to make additional disclosures.
Sources said that exemption from enhanced disclosures have been provided to FPIs which are sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), listed companies on certain global exchanges, public retail funds, and other regulated pooled investment vehicles with diversified global holdings.

The markets regulator had mandated additional disclosure norms for high risk FPIs after it observed that certain FPIs were holding concentrated portion of their equity portfolio in a single investee company/ corporate group.
Such concentrated investments raise the concern and possibility that promoters of such investee companies/ corporate groups, or other investors acting in concert, could be using the FPI route for circumventing regulatory requirements such as that of disclosures under Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations, 2011 (SAST Regulations) or maintaining Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) in the listed company, Sebi had said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sharing-of-investor-data-with-sebi-fpis-get-seven-months-to-liquidate-their-holdings-9126379/,business

Also, this week is when the goods and services tax (GST) outflow happens,” said a treasury head of a private sector bank.","The liquidity in the banking system has turned deficit to a record high of Rs 3.4 lakh crore on Wednesday due to moderation in government spending, higher tax outflows and slower bank deposit growth.
Analysts expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to announce permanent liquidity measures such as open market operations (OMO) purchases to ease liquidity deficit conditions in the banking system rather than variable repo rate auctions (VRR) to infuse temporary liquidity.
“The primary reason for this (liquidity deficit) is that the government is not spending much. Also, this week is when the goods and services tax (GST) outflow happens,” said a treasury head of a private sector bank.

Banking system liquidity, as reflected by the amount of money injected by the RBI into the banking system, has been in deficit mode since last month after advance tax and goods and services tax (GST) payments.
On a net basis, the RBI has injected liquidity averaging Rs 1.8 trillion between December 16, 2023 and January 14, 2024.
Higher outflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have also led to the widening of banking system liquidity, analysts said. So far in the current month, FPIs have pulled out Rs 19,308 crore of local shares on a net basis in January so far, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).
According to Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda, the liquidity tightness is a case of deposits rising at a slower pace compared to the growth in credit.

In the fortnight ended December 29, the bank deposits grew by 13 per cent on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, while credit grew by 20 per cent, the latest RBI data showed. The growth includes the impact of the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank.
A large amount of retail deposits migrating to mutual funds has also resulted in a slower growth in deposits, Sabnavis said.
The RBI has been conducting VRR auctions to infuse liquidity into the banking system. Between December 16 and January 14, it conducted five variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of 2-7 days maturity and a main operation (13 days) amounting to Rs 1.75 lakh crore. On January 24, the RBI announced a 15-day VRR worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore.

Bankers said the RBI wants liquidity to remain in the deficit mode as consumer priced-based inflation (CPI) continues to remain above its target of 4 per cent. Retail inflation, or CPI, edged up to 5.7 per cent in December 2023 from 5.6 per cent in November.
If the ongoing liquidity conditions persist, the RBI will necessarily have to infuse more durable liquidity into the banking system, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in a report.
“Sustained tightness in the banking system liquidity could prove to be onerous for borrowers and will worsen in case if government spending does not accelerate in a meaningful way. Therefore, the infusion of durable liquidity is becoming necessary and idealistically, the monetary policy stance should change to ‘neutral’ from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to maintain consistency of stance and action,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, Director, Core Analytical Group, Ind-Ra.
While an increase in FPI inflow owing to the inclusion in Global Bond Indices will improve the liquidity situation, the surge in cash-in-circulation ahead of the parliamentary election will keep the RBI on toes, notwithstanding the beginning of government spending in April 2024 and relatively weak credit season, the rating agency said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/banking-system-liquidity-deficit-at-record-high-of-rs-3-4-lakh-crore-9126361/,business

"Online retailer eBay to slash 1,000 jobs, reduce contracts","San Jose, California-based eBay is the latest tech company to roll out a series of layoffs after quickly ramping up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic while people spent more time and money online.","Online retailer eBay Inc will cut about 1,000 jobs, or an estimated 9% of its full-time workforce, saying its number of employees and costs have exceeded how much the business is growing in a slowing economy. It marks the latest layoffs in the tech industry.
CEO Jamie Iannone said in a message to employees on Tuesday that the company also will reduce how many “contracts we have within our alternate workforce over the coming months”.
Those who are being laid off will be told through Zoom calls with their bosses, Iannone said, requesting that people work from home Wednesday to allow privacy for those conversations.

“We need to better organise our teams for speed — allowing us to be more nimble, bring like-work together, and help us make decisions more quickly,” he said in the note, which was posted online.
“These changes are difficult, but I’m confident that by working together we will become stronger than ever,” Iannone added.
San Jose, California-based eBay is the latest tech company to roll out a series of layoffs after quickly ramping up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic while people spent more time and money online.
Now, companies from Google to Amazon have been making painful job cuts to reduce costs and bolster their bottom lines.
ADVERTISEMENT
Just this month, Google said it was laying off hundreds of employees working on its hardware, voice assistance and engineering teams, while TikTok said its shedding dozens of workers in ads and sales and video game developer Riot Games, behind the popular “League of Legends” multiplayer battle game, was trimming 11% of its staff.
Meanwhile, Amazon said this month that it is cutting several hundred jobs in its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit.
The online retail giant owns two other companies that announced major layoffs in January: Audible, the online audiobook and podcast service, which is trimming about 5% of its workforce, and streaming platform Twitch that is cutting more than 500 jobs.
ADVERTISEMENT
Other tech companies, including Spotify, Microsoft, Meta and IBM, also have recently cut jobs.
They’re running into a slowing economy following rapid interest rate hikes unleashed by central banks around the world to combat soaring inflation.
The head of eBay pointed to those concerns in the need to trim its workforce: “Despite facing external pressures, like the challenging macroeconomic environment, we know we can be better with the factors we control,” Iannone said.
The company has also faced internal problems that hurt its business. The online retailer will pay a $3 million fine to resolve US criminal charges over a harassment campaign waged by employees who sent live spiders, cockroaches and other disturbing items to the home of a Massachusetts couple, according to court documents this month.
The Justice Department charged eBay with stalking, witness tampering and obstruction of justice more than three years after the employees were prosecuted in an extensive scheme to intimidate a couple who produced an online newsletter called EcommerceBytes that upset eBay executives with its coverage.

"Why the hike in import duty for gold, silver findings and coins? Policy makers say move aimed at tackling arbitrage",Rise in gold prices and duties are also seen as the key reasons for higher gold smuggling in the country.,"In a bid to remove the loophole of a tax arbitrage between different types of gold and silver items, the Finance Ministry on Tuesday raised import duty on gold and silver findings and coins of precious metals to 15 per cent. Higher imports of gold and silver findings — which are small components such as hooks, clasps, clamps, pins, screws used to hold the whole or a part of a piece of jewellery in place — led the government to hike the import duty for them at par with gold and silver bars.
Gold and silver bars faced a 15 per cent import duty, while gold and silver findings attracted 11 per cent import duty. Owing to this duty arbitrage, it was found that there was a significant surge in imports of gold findings in the last two months, a senior government official told The Indian Express.

According to a DGCA statement, the action follows a “comprehensive investigation” that was initiated after an airline employee filed a voluntary safety report with the regulator, alleging safety violations on Air India flights “on certain long range terrain critical routes”. The investigation prima facie revealed non-compliance by the airline, after which a show cause notice was issued to Air India.

India’s sunflower imports to falter as Red Sea attacks lift freight costs,"The world's biggest sunflower oil buyer typically sources most of its imports from the Black Sea region via the Red Sea. However, recent Houthi attacks have compelled shipping companies to reroute trade between Europe and Asia around Africa, increasing time and costs.","India’s sunflower oil imports are set to decline in coming months as a rally in prices, driven by a surge in freight rates, is prompting buyers to shift to rival vegetable oils available at a discount, traders told Reuters.
The world’s biggest sunflower oil buyer typically sources most of its imports from the Black Sea region via the Red Sea. However, recent Houthi attacks have compelled shipping companies to reroute trade between Europe and Asia around Africa, increasing time and costs.
The elevated freight rates have lifted the landed cost of sunflower oil above that of soyoil in India for the first time in nearly a year, said Sandeep Bajoria, CEO of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil brokerage.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Sunoil imports were robust in the last few months due to the price advantage it had over soyoil. However, it lost this advantage because of rising freight,” he said.
Crude sunflower oil imports are currently offered at about $943 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF), in India for February delivery, while crude soyoil is offered at around $935 and crude palm oil at $933, dealers said.
Two months ago, sunflower oil was trading at a $120 per ton discount to soyoil, which encouraged Indian traders to increase sunoil imports.
In December, India’s sunoil imports more than doubled from a month earlier to 260,850 tons.
ADVERTISEMENT
Soyoil imports in December rose by 1.8% to 152,650 tons but remained significantly below the average imports of 306,000 tons in the marketing year that ended in October 2023.
In January, sunflower oil imports could fall to 225,000 tons as soyoil imports are likely to jump above 230,000 tons, said Rajesh Patel, managing partner at edible oil trader and broker GGN Research.
“In the coming months sunflower oil imports would go down to around 200,000 tons if the current price trend continues,” Patel said.
ADVERTISEMENT
India buys palm oil mainly from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, while it imports soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.
Argentina is currently offering sunoil at more competitive prices than supplies from Black Sea region countries, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trade house. Red Sea shipping disruptions would prompt India to buy more soyoil from South America and less sunoil from the Black Sea region, he said.

Union Budget 2024: Expectations from agriculture sector,It is expected that the agriculture budget for 2024-25 addresses multiple pain-points of the sector simultaneously.,"India’s growing population along with a constant rise in income levels is leading to a constant increase in demand for agricultural products and increasing burden on existing agricultural resources. The prevailing scenario indicates a need to improve productivity along with reducing costs and improving quality to make the most efficient use of the available resources. The growing adoption of cutting-edge agricultural techniques as well as incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information systems (GIS), drones, and remote sensing-based technologies in agriculture is a step in the right direction.
Current challenges faced by the sector
Although the agriculture sector has transformed significantly over the last few decades, challenges like fragmented landholdings, low productivity, limited mechanization, minimal value addition opportunities and insufficient credit availability prevent farmers from realizing higher prices. Another major problem is inefficient extension mechanisms, which makes it difficult for advanced agricultural practices to reach each and every farmer. Due to this farmers still use basic, traditional methods for cultivation.

SPNI had initially said that it had not yet agreed to the deadline extension request by ZEEL. But later, it agreed to discuss the matter.

The proposed USD 10-billion merger had already received regulatory approvals from fair trade regulator CCI, NSE and BSE, shareholders and creditors of the company. In August last year, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also gave a go-ahead to the merger.

But most passengers today have only heard about this pinnacle of Air India’s service quality, for they have been used to a product that reflected the carrier’s woes–acute financial distress, excessive government interference, and inefficiencies that mar many a public sector company. Rundown planes with poor upkeep became the hallmark of India’s flag carrier. Now back in the Tata fold after its privatisaton, Air India is aiming to restore the famed status it enjoyed decades ago.

We look forward to a written apology and statement about the progress of the tests today. Not only with technical errors, but also the error on the ELAT.

“How will the admissions process go ahead from this? I freezed after 20 minutes and was forced to stare at my screen for another 3 HOURS whilst other students froze 2 hours in but had another hour to CHECK their answers and DISCUSS answers with fellow students,” an X user, David John, posted.
“What is going to happen to those who did the elat when there was an error in the question leaving many students who didn’t know at a disadvantage,” another X user, Emma, posted.
Preparation is irrelevant if the paper won't launch or keeps freezing. And not even a working hotline number to call for assistance on the day! Very poor.

"‘With flexibility, access to maths and science courses, engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad’","Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter).","— Chetan D. Pahlajani
It’s the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) season, and so amidst the anxiety and anticipation capping years of hard work, you possibly find yourself wondering: “If I can make it to one of my preferred IITs, which BTech programme should I choose?” You look up the top choices: “Okay, Computer Science, then. But I think Mechanical or Electrical Engineering may be much broader. What about Chemical or Civil?” There’s input from friends and family, which might not all of is necessarily helpful. And then, perhaps, you love the sciences, but are ambivalent about engineering, and wonder: “Is engineering even the right choice for me? Perhaps I might be better off pursuing an Integrated MSc in the physical sciences.”
These are difficult questions with no easy answers, and so, when the time comes, one will have to make an important life decision with incomplete information. The good news is that very often, one’s academic and professional trajectory and eventual success may not depend so much on making the perfect choice, but simply on making a good enough choice. Part of the reason is that a good BTech programme at many of the IITs is a remarkably good springboard for a variety of career paths, as is evident from the biographies of numerous distinguished IIT alumni.

However, I want to turn my attention to the last group of students mentioned above, passionate about science but unsure about engineering. I too once belonged to that group, and following conventional wisdom at the time, chose engineering (though not at an IIT). What followed were a few not-so-happy years, but I fortunately had the opportunity to take several advanced Mathematics courses, and secured admission to a PhD programme in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I wrote my doctoral thesis in Probability Theory guided by an advisor who, interestingly enough, had also started as a student in Electrical Engineering and then switched to a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I got a postdoctoral position, worked in the US for a few years, joined IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) in 2014, and lived happily ever after. More or less…
Anyway, back to you and your predicament. Well, one thing I have learned over the years is just how versatile an engineering degree can be, provided one can also take courses in one’s area of interest, whatever that may be. This brings me back to the IITs, specifically IITGN, since it is the only IIT where I have worked. Two big strengths of the BTech programme at IITGN are equipping engineering students with a solid foundation in the basic sciences, and providing students the chance to explore numerous courses outside their major. With Mathematics, all students are required to take a few core courses: single and multivariable calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. Additionally, each engineering department may require their students to take specific courses.
Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter). Further, students who have completed at least four semesters with satisfactory academic performance can also apply for a joint BTech/MSc dual degree, where the additional MSc degree can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. We recently had a BTech student from Mechanical Engineering take this route, also completing an MSc in Mathematics in the process. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Ohio State University.
The take-home message here is that with a bit of flexibility and access to Mathematics and Science courses, an Engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad for pursuing higher education and a career in these fields. Besides academics, Mathematics PhDs have found careers in Quantitative Finance, and more recently, in Data Science. And so, if you think your dream is to study the Navier-Stokes equations or Algebraic Geometry or Particle Physics or Neuroscience — but you’re not yet sure — a good BTech programme might not be a bad place to start.

The day will be celebrated with several events such as ‘High level dialogue on learning for lasting peace’ at UNHQ (New York), a festival on the lines of ‘Learning to take care of oneself, others and the planet’, and much more.
Why is it celebrated on January 24?
In 2018, January 24 was declared as the International Day of Education by a resolution that was passed by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on December 3, 2018. Following this, the first International Day of Education was observed on January 24, 2019.
Read | International Education Day 2024: Indian students need to work on soft skills, say experts
Since then, January 24 is annually celebrated as the International Day of Education. The 2024 celebration is the sixth year of celebration.
Understanding this year’s theme
The theme of the 2024 celebrations is ‘learning for lasting peace’. The thought behind this theme has been explained by the UNESCO as: the world is seeing a surge of violent conflicts paralleled by an alarming rise of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and hate speech. The impact of this violence transcends any boundary based on geography, gender, race, religion, politics, offline and online. An active commitment to peace is more urgent today than ever: Education is central to this endeavor, as underlined by the UNESCO Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development. Learning for peace must be transformative, and help empower learners with the necessary knowledge, values, attitudes and skills and behaviours to become agents of peace in their communities.
“The accelerated spread of hate speech is a threat to all communities. Our best defense is education, which must be at the heart of any peace efforts. It is our collective duty to empower learners of all ages to deconstruct hate speech, and lay the foundations for inclusive, democratic and human-rights respecting societies. To succeed, we need to better train and support teachers who are on the front lines in overcoming this phenomenon,” Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General said.

"JEE Main v/s NEET UG: Check main differences in subject preparation, important chapters",Understanding the nuances and aligning study approaches with the specific exam requirements are crucial for aspirants aiming to excel in either of these competitive examinations.,"— Nabin Kaarki
The journey toward success in competitive exams like NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) and JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) is marked by rigorous preparation. Both exams — NEET for medical aspirants and JEE for engineering — demand meticulous planning and a structured approach. However, the strategies for subject-specific preparation in these exams have unique subtleties that are crucial for aspirants looking to succeed in these challenging tests.
Biology vs. Mathematics
NEET aspirants prioritise Biology, a substantial section of the exam (50 per cent), focusing on comprehensive understanding, memorisation, and interpretation of biological concepts, complemented by extensive reading of NCERT books. In contrast, JEE applicants delve deeply into mathematics, emphasising problem-solving skills and a profound understanding of complex mathematical concepts through various resources.

Jannik Sinner’s strong and improved baseline game helps him stun Novak Djokovic to reach Australian Open final,"Baseline strategy has been central to Jannik Sinner's game and he has been working on it with his new coaching team since the start of 2022 – led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi’s former coach.","In a resolute, nerveless, three-hour-long display of destructive shot making and tactical mastery, Jannik Sinner, the rising 22-year-old World No.4, defeated Novak Djokovic 6-1, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3 in the semifinals of the Australian Open on Friday, reaching his first Major final and becoming the first Italian man to reach the singles final in Melbourne.
Sinner outplayed and outmanoeuvred the undisputed king of Melbourne Park – and men’s tennis in general – and in doing so, not only strengthened his long-held credentials as a potential great in the making, but also achieved a feat that none of the Serb’s greatest rivals had been able to accomplish even at the peak of their careers.
Prior to Friday, 10-time champion Djokovic had never lost in the semifinal or final of the Australian Open. A perfect 20-0 record. He was 33 matches unbeaten in Melbourne, a streak that went back to 2018 – 2195 days, as the broadcasters were keen to point out every chance they got.
Savour the moment @janniksin 🥕#AusOpen • #AO2024 pic.twitter.com/FTSDsa2AOp
— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 26, 2024
The Serb’s dominance of the Slams, and particularly Melbourne Park, was not simply down to extraordinary tennis repertoire, but instead part of a legacy built on a near-supernatural ability to expose best-of-five tennis for the collection of short sprints that it is, as opposed to the consistent long run marathon it has always been claimed to be.
Even when thoroughly outplayed, Djokovic has always possessed the athleticism and presence of mind to take matches deep, win the pressure points, keep himself competitive enough to give himself a chance to win the match in the finer margins.
So, Sinner’s statement-making victory was not completed during the first half of the match, when the solid Italian took advantage of a streaky-looking Djokovic to race into an early two-set lead. Instead, it was earned during the second half, when he prevented the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who raised his game to try to take the contest deep, from completing one of his signature comebacks.
Superior in all departments
Djokovic was unquestionably flat at the start of this match, and his second-half recovery was never too convincing either, similar to his level in his first five matches of the tournament. Out of 90 completed points in the first two sets, Djokovic made 29 unforced errors.
He would admit to this himself, cutting a disappointed figure in his post-match press conference. “I was, in a way, shocked with my level, in a bad way,” he said. “This is one of the worst Grand Slam matches I’ve ever played, at least that I remember… This tournament hasn’t been, as I said, up to my standard or criteria or the level that I would normally play or expect myself to play”
And Sinner was in diametrically opposite form.
Scintillating Sinner 🇮🇹🔥

Baseline strategy has formed a primary emphasis of the work he has been doing with his new coaching team – led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi’s former coach – since the start of 2022 and he nailed it in the biggest result of his career. The Italian’s lean, wiry frame and composed demeanour do not betray the full strength of the destructive power that comes off his racquet.
His pure ball striking ability would send Djokovic trailing to catch balls, and his aggression from start to finish allowed him to finish points before Djokovic could even get balls back into play to wear him down. Djokovic was out of sorts, but it was Sinner’s baseline prowess that had him totally out of his comfort zone, making him rush his shots and extracting errors.
Despite it not being the highlight of his game, Sinner served exceptionally – according to Opta, this is the first Grand Slam match of Djokovic’s 19-year-long career where he did not even have a single break point opportunity.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sinner won 80 of the points when the rallies were four shots or less, as opposed to Djokovic’s 43. In the first two sets, that number is 32-16, showing just how well Sinner was serving and returning, and keeping points short to keep Djokovic out of his comfort zone.
Maintaining composure
Djokovic was subpar throughout the match, but recovered from the first two sets reasonably, he began to raise his level just enough to make sure he can take advantage if the player on the other side of the net buckled.
Lesser players would have tightened up one set away from the biggest result of their career, but Sinner’s concentration never wavered. Even as Djokovic improved, the Italian stayed true to his aggressive strategy, and served consistently well to get over the line in the pressure moments and take the third set into a tiebreaker, where Djokovic typically showed signs of life and recovered from match point down – with an expertly executed lob no less – to edge the tiebreaker. Another famous turnaround was lurking.
A lightning fast start from @janniksin ⚡

But Sinner never cowered, coming out in the fourth set just as he had done all match – bombing down serves, putting pressure on Djokovic through aggressive return strategy, and striking the ball as purely as he had done from the start.
It would be Djokovic who would blink. After saving two break points earlier in the set, his serve would be broken on a game in which he was 40-0 up. Anyone familiar with Djokovic’s history would be aware that the match is far from over, but Sinner served out the win with the freedom of a player that was not simply attempting to protect his lead, but outrightly going for the kill.
Ever since he was a teenager, hype has swirled around the lethal nature of his shotmaking and complete nature of his game. After growing into his body and peaking physically, Sinner’s tendency to collapse meant he needed to prove that he could hold his nerve against an all-time great opponent with the Grand Slam pressure on him. After picking up his third win in four matches against Djokovic, and reaching his first Major final, some of those doubts have surely been put to bed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/jannik-sinners-strong-and-improved-baseline-game-helps-him-stun-novak-djokovic-to-reach-australian-open-final-9129073/,sports
"Allan Border opens up about Parkinson’s disease: ‘I’m not scared, but I am worried about the slow decline process’","Former Australia captain says the disease has softened him a bit, which is embarrassing and good at the same time.","Legendary Australia cricketer Allan Border has opened up about his fight with Parkinson’s disease and revealed why he is scared about the “slow decline process.”
“My health is good apart from having Parkinson’s my general health is pretty good,” Border said on Fox Cricket’s at tea on day two of the day-night pink ball Test match played between Australia and West Indies.
“I still play golf. I still go for walks and can do all the things I normally do. I am not running any marathons anymore, but apart from that things are pretty good.”
Border, who was also the first player in history to score 11,000 Test runs, was diagnosed with the brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements in 2016.
“It is a neurological disorder where the brain stops developing a thing called dopamine, which affects muscles and your nervous system,” he explained.
Having made his national team debut in 1978, Border went on to play 156 Tests and 273 ODIs for Australia until 1994, scoring over 17,698 runs that consisted of 30 centuries. In first-class cricket, he’d score over 27,000 runs that included a staggering 70 centuries.
“I didn’t know much about Parkinson’s. The first thing that came to my mind at the time was Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic Cauldron, so I just thought, oh my god.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It was just a strange feeling and a strange trip home. My better half Jane was with me and we just thought, bloody hell what does this actually mean?”
Having skippered Australian men’s cricket team to their first world title in 1987, Border was also part of the 55 inaugural ICC Cricket Hall of Fame inductees in 2009 and is one of the two names after whom the India-Australia Test series is nomenclatured.
“I’m not so much scared, but I am worried yeah about that slow decline process,” Border said.
“I am worried about that and I have sort of taken the route that the less I know the better, where as Jane my wife has gone the other way and she knows everything.
ADVERTISEMENT
“I do get lectured quite often about, you haven’t been for a walk for a couple of days or what are you doing drinking all those beers? And all the stuff I shouldn’t be doing.
“But I am being kept on the straight and narrow by Jane and a good medical team.”
During the chat Mark Howard also revealed the text he sent to Wasim Akram.
“It hasn’t changed me too much, I am getting a lot of good well wishes, which is embarrassing but good. I don’t know whether I have become softer in my approach to how I talk to people,” Border said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“You sent a message to the group and to Wasim Akram telling him how much you loved him,” asked Howard.
“We were with him at the time and he was completely overwhelmed. That was a beautiful thing that AB sent through and it had a massive impact on him.”
Border laughed and spoke about the admiration, he have for Pakistan legend.

Australian Open 2024: Jannik Sinner stops Novak Djokovic’s bid to win 11th Australian Open and 25th Grand Slam,"Sinner defeated Djokovic 6-1, 6-2, 6-7, 6-3 in the semfinals of the Australian Open.","Jannik Sinner has stunned Novak Djokovic to reach the Australian Open men’s final, his first Grand Slam final and also ended the 10-time champion’s career unbeaten streak in semifinals at Melbourne Park.
Sinner defeated Djokovic 6-1, 6-2, 6-7, 6-3 in the semfinals of the Australian Open.
“It’s always nice to have this kind of player who you can learn from,” Sinner said in his on-court TV interview.
“I lost last year in the semifinals in Wimbledon and I learned a lot from that. The confidence from the end of last year has for sure kept the belief that I can play the best players in the world.”

“He’s deservedly in the finals. He outplayed me completely,” Djokovic said after the match.
“Look, I was, in a way, shocked with my level — in a bad way. There was not much I was doing right in the first two sets.
“Yeah, I guess this is one of the worst Grand Slam matches I’ve ever played. At least that I remember.”
He hadn’t lost a match at Melbourne Park since 2018 and was on a 33-match winning streak at the season’s first major. Every previous time he’d won a quarterfinal in Australia, Djokovic had gone on to win the hardcourt title.
Sinner is in red-hot form – he has won 19 of his last 20 matches and clinched two ATP titles and the Davis Cup since October – and he had also defeated Djokovic twice in three meetings over 12 days at the back end of last year.

‘It looked like a dead lbw’: Ben Duckett on Shubman Gill surviving a close call,Duckett believes England are still in the game and they can take wickets in cluster to put India on the back foot.,"England opener Ben Duckett says Shubman Gill surviving a close call looked like a “dead lbw” and still believes that if they can take wickets in cluster to put India on the back foot.
“It feels like a tricky pitch to start on,” he told reporters.
“Shubman (Gill) there, we could have had him. It looked like a dead lbw (when he was struck on the pad by Tom Hartley) and somehow, it’s bouncing over the stumps. It’s one of those things.
“We’ll stick to our mantra and that’s taking wickets and looking to be positive. Hopefully, that will happen for us as well.”
India will resume from 119 for 1 on Day 2 and Yashasvi Jaiswal’s attacking gameplan has taken England by surprise but with pitch deteriorating quickly, England are still in the match.
“You have to pay credit to them… they played really well and were very attacking, which is positive,” he said.
“They don’t always go about it like that, so to go about it that way shows that they probably think that pitch is going to get quite a bit worse.

“That’s going to happen out here, and that’s something that we’ll have good belief in when we’re bowling,” Duckett said.
“We could easily take three or four (wickets) tomorrow morning for 10 runs.”
Despite getting bowled out on 246, the England opener feels they are in a strong position.
We are very happy being bowled out for what we got,” Duckett told BBC Sport.

“Hopefully we can take two or three wickets early [on day two] and put them under pressure.”
“We’re in a strong position, regardless of them only being one down,” he added.
Duckett lauded skipper Ben Stokes knock.
“He’s the best in the world in those situations,” said Duckett.
“The way he soaked up pressure early on, trusted his defence, then when we were eight or nine down he let loose like he does all the time. That could be a match-winning innings for us.”

England left-arm spinner Tom Hartley’s first delivery in Test cricket was hit for a six by Yashasvi Jaiswal, who is unbeaten on 76 from 70 balls.
“We back Tommy,” said Duckett.

"In crunch time, Kiran George produces an aggressive finish to beat China’s World No.19 Lu Guang Zu","As Kiran George had missed out on opportunities to go deeper into draws, his coaches at the Prakash Padukone academy in Bangalore had been drilling into him the importance of a strong, aggressive finish.","Since the start of 2023, Kiran George had played out 14 tight finishes of 21-19, 22-20 or 23-21 score lines on the world tour, and won only 8 of those. One of India’s finest bludgeons from the back court, would fall back frustratingly in the endgame as his impressive strokeplay was rendered a footnote in losses.
On Thursday, Kiran, the world No.36, literally went ballistic in finishing in the Round of 16 at Indonesia Masters, winning 21-11, 13-21, 21-18 against China’s World No.19 Lu Guang Zu.
As he had missed out on opportunities to go deeper into draws, his coaches at the Prakash Padukone academy in Bangalore – Vimal Kumar, Sagar Chopda and DK Sen, had been drilling into him the importance of a strong, aggressive finish.
Kiran’s father George Thomas, had heard it all too often, how his son wasn’t pushing the pedal when required. It was a hard watch because George, the 1991 Indian national champion, was known for his blistering pace and muscled aggression while killing off points. Kiran’s soft exits stung.
Kiran’s father George Thomas was the 1991 Indian national champion.
After Thursday’s win in three, his father couldn’t contain his pride and was relieved at how the lad had finally unleashed his full aggression to nick a tight decider his way.
The first two sets swung equally and one-sidedly in either player’s direction. But it was in the decider when Kiran was three points adrift at 8-11 that the 23-year-old came charging at Lu. The hand speed showed a visible uptick, and Kiran stalked him all the way to 18-18, not conceding more than a 1 point lead.
The last three points from 18-all were pristine aggression as first a growling net dribble, then a signature scythe shot from the back and finally a lightning reflex from midcourt, all played at breathless speed, gave the Indian World No.36 a swashbuckling win over No.19 Zu to make the quarterfinals of a Super 500.

“Kiran is far too cool on the court, don’t know if it’s a good thing or bad. I was the opposite, very aggressive. But he has far superior strokeplay,” explained George who won subjunior, and junior Nationals in doubles and the U21 and seniors singles crown, gaining domestic renown.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Yet too many times he was leading by a big margin and still lost in recent years. People would say he lacks aggression. Internationally each point counts for a lot at the end.”
Kiran had beaten Chinese Shi Yuqi and Weng Hong Yang, who caused headaches to most Indians, rather easily last June. But a deep run in a tournament was missing, as headlines proved elusive.
Kiran had beaten Chinese Shi Yuqi and Weng Hong Yang, who caused headaches to most Indians, rather easily last June. But a deep run in a tournament was missing, as headlines proved elusive.
At Istora in Jakarta by Thursday, Kiran had played 4 matches including qualifying rounds, in 72 hours. All of them, three-setters.
After blitzing to take the Round 2 opener against Lu to whom he’d lost 21-10, 22-20 last October, Kiran watched the Chinese regroup and retaliate. Lu has a strong power game, a decent defense, and got his straight hits going to pull Kiran into a decider. The Indian was defending well in the second, but not taking his chances falling back 3-11, and eventually submitting 13-21.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lu was hell bent in the decider on testing Kiran on the forehand far corner, pushing him back, because the Indian was proving too dangerous at the net. Lu underestimated just how good Kiran can be from the back court.
Not only does the Indian hit deep and hard from baseline, he has perhaps the best deception amongst Indians from the back. His long hits travel with a deep baritone. Both his slow drops and fast pushes fetch him points, even if he’s chased away from the net, where his tight dribbles aren’t bad at all.
Kiran’s repertoire of disguises and strokes from the back is classical, and the footwork moving front and back from corners to centre is so smooth and swift that he is never quite pinned to the baseline. The Chinese just couldn’t thwart Kiran merely by pinging him continually to that forehand back corner. The whip on the shuttle was audible and audacious.
Much to the chagrin of Lu, who tried to blast through, Kiran also unfurled some stinging winners struck when backtracking, showing spectacular balance on the move, as he anticipated and connected with the shuttle early. From 12-12, he was snapping at Lu’s heels, though the Chinese defense wasn’t wilting till 18-18.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lu had wins over Lee Zii Jia, Anthony Ginting and Jonatan Christie this month. But at this point, Kiran pushed the fourth gear, and didn’t take his foot off the pedal, slashing down three straight points, for a gutsy win on a day when Lakshya Sen and Priyanshu Rajawat faded off in straight sets.
At Istora in Jakarta by Thursday, Kiran had played 4 matches including qualifying rounds, in 72 hours. All of them, three-setters.
George Thomas who was on the Indian team with Padukone and admired how quietly focussed he would be, was glad Kiran had kept at it, against the big-hitting Chinese. “I’ve watched Prakash train many times, and observed how he was after wins and losses. He wouldn’t even talk around matches. Kiran is very meticulous and focussed, but he needs to keep at it till the end. The tournament is still to be won,” he said.
Pedigree & the punch
George began playing badminton on outdoor courts in Chengannur village in Alappuzha district of Kerala and was prodigiously talented. Winning straightaway at GV Raja Sports school with his strong speedy hitting, he had moved 100 km to capital Trivandrum, and continued to win, making the national camps at Patiala, where a Chinese coach honed his game ahead of the National title in 1991. His brother Suresh Thomas too played and coached at Regional Sports centre, where Kiran and his elder sibling learnt their early games.
George was known for his speed. Moving to Bangalore though, Kiran found coaching expertise and grew into a highly skilled stroke player with many variations. His drops and backcourt deception are highly evolved, but the smash kill can take two shots far too many to fetch up. It’s not a scary smash yet, strictly make-do, but Kiran has far too many variations to be tied down. “People say he doesn’t have aggression. And he’s not naturally built, the muscle strength is still not wholly developed. But his strokes are good and he’s very positive. He got a little desperate after losing Thomas Cup trials, but usually he rebounds fast after losses,” his father says.
ADVERTISEMENT
As a former player watching his son get all the technical and financial support, George says Kiran must take the next step. “He’s lucky he’s well supported. I tell him three things – stay focussed till the end, take care of your body and learn to peak for big matches. At this level, everyone has strength and fitness. But the best players know to peak in big moments.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/kiran-george-produces-aggressive-finish-to-beat-chinas-lu-guang-zu-9128103/,sports
"Sarfaraz and Musheer: Two brothers, 7,625km apart, one scored a century for India A, the other for India colts in U-19 World Cup","Father Naushad Khan gives credit to Mumbai’s khadoos cricket in both sons’ journeys, says Sarfaraz will get his India cap soon.","Naushad Khan was flooded with congratulatory messages and calls the moment he switched on his phone after landing in Mumbai. His elder son, Sarfaraz, playing for India A, had scored a first-class century against England Lions in Ahmedabad, while 7,625km away at Bloemfontein, his younger one Musheer had scored a match-winning ton in India’s 201-run win over Ireland in the U-19 World Cup.
“There are 800 unseen messages on my WhatsApp. All of them are about Sarfaraz and Musheer. I will go home and reply to each one of them,” Naushad tells The Indian Express from Mumbai.
On Wednesday, Naushad was in Hyderabad for BCCI’s annual function to collect the Madhav Rao Scindia award for the highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy. Sarfaraz was the tournament’s leading scorer with 982 runs. He has dominated India’s domestic circuit for the past three years but is still knocking on the doors of the Indian cricket team. Since 2020, he has scored more than 2,000 runs at an average of 82 but is yet to get an India call.
When asked what his son needs to do to get selected for India, Naushad smiles and says: “Just keep scoring runs.”
“I was not supposed to go for this award but since Sarfaraz had a match the next day, I had to. I am glad that I went to Hyderabad and the kind of compliments I have received about Sarfaraz has given me a confidence boost.
For his incredible century in the first-innings, Musheer Khan is adjudged the Player of the Match 👏👏#TeamIndia win by 201 runs 👌👌

“BCCI ne usey award diya aur mujhe yakeen hai BCCI usey Test cap bhi dega (BCCI has given him an award and I am sure they will give him a Test cap as well),” the proud father says.
Sarfaraz, who missed out on a century by four runs in the warm-up match against England Lions, and failed to convert his half-century in the first unofficial Test, hammered 161 off 160 balls, his first century for India A.
Musheer shows promise
In South Africa, the younger Khan, who has yet to deliver on the promise that he has shown in BCCI’s age-group competitions, scored his first century in U-19 cricket. Interestingly, Sarfaraz has a record of scoring seven fifty-plus total, the most in an U-19 World Cup, but never had a century.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the post-match presentation, Musheer said he and his brother have a “similar style of batting.” They both are busy and love to score big. Musheer struggled in the opening match against Bangladesh but showed composure in the second. He completed his half-century in 66 balls and then changed gears to score the next 50 in just 34 balls.
“I hurried a bit for runs in the last match, so I gave myself some time in this match. I got the result,” he says.
Musheer hit four sixes in his knock, all of them in the second half of his knock. His favourite was the one over mid-wicket against medium pacer Oliver Riley. The shot got him going.

“Musheer is an opener. He has got a very calm head on his shoulders. He has got the best of both games. He can change gears as per situation and conditions,” says Naushad.

“I spoke to him after the Bangladesh match. He was in good nick but was just not able to get a big one. Now the monkey is off the back. To be honest, with VVS Laxman and Hrishikesh Kanitkar around him, I don’t need to tell him anything. He is in safe hands.”
Mumbai’s khadoos cricket
The Mumbai school of batting preaches filling one’s boots when the opportunity presents itself, not throwing one’s wicket away once in. That’s what Sarfaraz in Ahmedabad and Musheer in Bloemfontein showed.
Naushad gives credit to Mumbai’s cricketing system and BCCI’s structure for the growth of both his sons.

“I have done my bit because they are my sons. But Mumbai cricket has played a bigger role in the development of their game. The khadoos cricketing culture of Mumbai has made them hungry for runs,” he says.

“In Mumbai, they are used to playing two-day and three-day games from a very young age and by the time they get to the NCA (National Cricket Academy), they are ready to play higher-level cricket. The BCCI’s structure is also so robust that if you work hard, you can dominate the tournaments consistently.
“There is a lot of cricket. They play U-14s, U-16s, U-19s, U-23s and then for the senior team. Not to forget all the different formats as well. A coach can work on the players but it is the structure that takes them to different levels,” explains Naushad.
Tour down memory lane
Naushad gets emotional while talking about his journey. Back in 2014, he had watched his eldest son Sarfaraz make his India U-19 debut with an eight-year-old Musheer on his lap. Almost a decade later, both his sons scored centuries on the same day but he couldn’t watch it. The India A match is not on television, while he was on a flight when Musheer reached the three-figure mark.
“I will watch their batting videos in the morning,” he laughs.

Over the years, Naushad has spent hours dishing out throw-downs, and has travelled across the country with his sons just to play matches. He couldn’t help himself turning nostalgic while talking about the journey.

“Maine pehle hi bol diya tha unko achha baap chahiye ya achha coach (I have asked both of them at a very early age whether they want a father or a good coach),” he reminisces.
“I am a very punctual guy. For me, time is money. I get up early in the morning, I sleep on time. I avoid going to family functions. I have followed this routine for years now and the only reason is that in the morning they (his sons) shouldn’t miss their practice,” he says.

"Australian Open: Jannik Sinner can match Novak Djokovic in his game, but can he emulate the Serb’s appetite for the big stage?","Italian has beaten World No.1 in two their last three meetings, but the legend is usually at his best late in a Grand Slam.","For Novak Djokovic, hunting a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title, the biggest threat in the main draw of the Australian Open may not have been a rematch of his epic five-set Wimbledon final defeat to 20-year-old Spanish phenomenon Carlos Alcaraz. The highly-anticipated potential semifinal between Djokovic, the greatest tennis player on the big stage, and Jannik Sinner, the 22-year-old World No. 4 from Italy on an unparalleled hot streak, is now a reality, as well as a small headache for the World No. 1.
Friday’s semifinal has the potential to be a seminal moment in Sinner’s career. Not only is he in red-hot form – he has won 18 of his last 19 matches and clinched two ATP titles and the Davis Cup since October – but he has also defeated Djokovic twice in three meetings over 12 days at the back end of last year.
Sinner beat Djokovic in a three-set epic in their group-stage match at the ATP season-ender, but Djokovic got his revenge in the final. When they met in the Davis Cup the week after, Sinner prevailed in extraordinary fashion, saving two match points and making Djokovic unusually buckle under pressure.
Djokovic’s tendency to raise his level in big moments, Sinner’s form, and the pair’s three recent meetings only heighten the anticipation, and give plenty away regarding where this match can be won and lost.

— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 25, 2024
Backhand mismatch
For so long has Djokovic used his backhand to flatten out opponents and isolate their weaknesses that he has increasingly relied on it as a comfortable rally option, which is not the case when facing the heaviest backhand on the tour.
Rev-for-rev, Sinner’s backhand is not only more powerful than most on tour, but it is an extremely versatile option from the baseline. Among the many improvements that have come in his game after he started working with coach Darren Cahill – including an improved serve and better fitness – baseline strategy has been refined more than anything else. The Italian uses his pure shot-making to push opponents into awkward positions and open up the court to put the ball away. His backhand down the line is the most useful option for winners, but his backhand crosscourt is the most useful rally weapon.

— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 24, 2024
Djokovic fell for this in the first of their three meetings in November, allowing Sinner to dictate with his backhand crosscourt, contending but eventually succumbing to the power Sinner’s pure ball striking tends to create. He solved this problem in their next match that he won in the same week, bringing his forehand into play as an attacking strategy, and staying aggressive, not passive, from the baseline.
This match may well be defined by how much Djokovic is able to keep Sinner preoccupied on his forehand side, and how often the Serb goes for the gutsier backhand down-the-line as opposed to bashing it out in long crosscourt rallies.
Seizing key moments
ADVERTISEMENT
Many aspects of both their playing styles may make this match live up to the hype. Sinner is a pure ball striker, Djokovic can absorb pressure and turn defence into offence. Sinner has an improved serve, Djokovic is an elite returner. Sinner has superior athleticism and footspeed, Djokovic has greater variety.

Djokovic’s greatest strength is his appetite for the big stage. The Serb has been far from his best in Melbourne so far, so count on him to raise his level for a big match, and even when he is being outplayed, he will once again pull out all the stops to stay alive in a match and drag his opponent to pressure moments and wait for them to blink.
But during his burst of form in the past six months, Sinner has shown composure even under immense pressure. In five matches at the Australian Open so far, he has won 26 of the 28 break points he has faced. In the quarterfinal against Andrey Rublev, he won the second set tiebreaker despite trailing 2-5. Both his recent wins against Djokovic came after he was put under the pump – the first in a deciding set tiebreak, and the second after being double match point down. According to the ‘Under Pressure’ leaderboard, official stats collected by the ATP say Sinner is the second-best player under pressure behind Djokovic, thanks in most part to him having saved 70 percent of break points he has faced.

IND vs ENG: How India’s batsmen capitalised on England’s callow bowling group,"With just one seamer, a spin pair with an experience of one game, Jaiswal made merry of England’s inexperience.","At the end of Day One, of a series that promises plenty of thrills and twists, Yashasvi Jaiswal, with an unbeaten 76 off 70 deliveries, has opened up a glaring hole in England’s set-up that has the potential to bury them down. Their inexperience.
Two of their three spinners with a combined experience of just one Test before this are not showing sufficient signs of complimenting Jack Leach, whose control alone may not be enough for them to get the job done, particularly on a pitch that is on the slower side. How much their decision to go without a second seamer could cost them only time will tell, but India have, so far, made full use of it.
Having restricted England to 246 on what is probably the most batting friendly surface in recent times (barring the one in Ahmedabad against Australia, which played out a draw), India’s response seems to suggest they want to bat just once and big. With 119/1 on board, and still trailing by 127 runs, a big first innings lead, which England cannot swat away quickly, will be India’s primary target on Day 2. If not, there is enough time in the Test for scripting comebacks. While the pitch at Hyderabad was not as hostile as it was in Nagpur, Delhi or Indore last year, in the Australia series, it is expected to undergo wear and tear as the game progresses. Batting last in India, as you would know, comes with its own risk.
READ | India vs England 1st Test: How Bazball played out amidst the craft and cunning of India’s spin trio
Axar Patel, who grabbed two wickets, including a ripper to dismiss Jonny Bairstow, summed up the pitch and outlined India’s plans. “They made 246 and we know that the wicket was good. There is spin but the wicket is slow and we know that we did well to restrict them to 246,” he said. “We will look to bat long and then runs will be taken care of. I don’t think the pitch is having any excessive spin, it’s just normal spin. As I said the pitch is slow and we can adjust to it as the ball is getting slow after pitching. It is a bit challenging as well for the batters but if you bat well then you can make runs here. It is challenging for bowlers as well because the outfield is quick here and you can go for runs if you err in line and length even slightly,” he added.
Purpose and intent
India’s response has been commendable so far. In the 23 overs they batted, they were all purpose and showed the intent that was needed to make full use of the good work their bowlers put in. With Wood being the lone seamer – Ben Stokes won’t be bowling because he has just recovered from a leg injury – he had to be on the dot and there was no room for error. But a gifted length delivery first up allowed Jaiswal to start with a boundary before he welcomed Tom Hartley to Test cricket with a six wide of long-on.

Four balls later, he swept him over the ropes. On such pitches, spells with the new ball tend to make a difference, but Wood – taking the new ball for the first time since 2015 – continued to be wayward, sending an eight-ball over in his second that hardly troubled Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma. As Hartley conceded 13 more of his second over, Ben Stokes would ultimately turn to Leach to find some control as early as the fifth over.
It was a fascinating approach from India, who despite wanting to bat long and big, were in the mood to take on the attack. This wasn’t mindless slogging, but a calculative approach, where they targeted the inexperienced spinners, not letting them settle down on a line and length, using the feet when needed to put pressure. The only mistake that India made with the bat was when Rohi tried to dish out the same punishing treatment to Leach, but managed only to mistime it as far as Stokes at mid-on. It led to a few nervy moments with Shubman Gill surviving a close LBW call, as even Jaiswal took pedal off a bit to limit any further damage.

Having put early pressure on Hartley and Rehan Ahmed, whose wrist-spin went for 22 runs in three overs, unless England pick early wickets on Day 2, they could well be in for a long day.

After consulting Ophthalmologists in Bangladesh and abroad and after multiple eye assessments, it was confirmed that he is suffering from Extrafoveal Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSR) of the left eye. It has been decided that a conservative approach will be adopted for managing the issue for now,” Senior BCB Physician Dr. Debashis Chowdhury said.
“Extrafoveal Central Serous Chorioretinopathy is a condition that affects the retina, leading to visual disturbances. The medical team overseeing Shakib’s case is optimistic about managing the condition effectively with a conservative approach.”
After the last BPL match, Riders captain Nurul Hasan had confirmed that Shakib was struggling with his eyes, following their five-wicket defeat to Fortune Barisal on January 20.
“He (Shakib) has been struggling with eyesight problem for sometimes now. I think he has been in touch with the doctors regularly. The doctors only could say in what stage the problem is now,” Nurul had said.

India vs England 1st Test: How Bazball played out amidst the craft and cunning of India’s spin trio,"England end Day One behind India, but only after producing an effective account of their bravado approach on a turning track.","More than the roar from the 24,000 odd spectators and the jubilant celebrations in the middle, it was the sigh of relief from the Indian players at the fall of every England batsman that defined Day 1 of the first Test. It was a day where England’s aggressive approach lived up to its hype until their charismatic captain Ben Stokes (70 off 88) fell as the last wicket.
A first innings total of 246 is definitely not the most damaging one—India have already sped to 119/1—that the Babzallers had inflicted on the opposition. However, on a turning track, in conditions where their approach was untested against three world-class spinners, it was as enterprising as it was anywhere else. This was not at all a bad beginning, though the challenge would be to prolong it a bit more.
This approach of England suited perfectly to the conditions that India threw up. They had more reasons to rely on it, as it gave them the best chance of putting as many runs on board before they were undone by India’s attack. Nothing illustrated it more than the dismissal of Jonny Bairstow. Having built a nice, steady partnership with Joe Root and despite living dangerously on a few occasions, the duo was beginning to concern India when Axar Patel delivered one with Bairstow’s name on it.
Bairstow did everything he had to the one that angled from Axar’s hands. A forward stride, bat placed before the pad, it was the classical stuff. But Axar – who had only picked three wickets in the four Tests against Australia – had found the right pace to bowl on this surface. It landed and spun viciously to hit the top of off. Maybe Bairstow’s forward stride could have been a bit longer. But against India’s spinners. who keep altering their length, moving front and back almost every alternate ball, looking to survive and score runs needs extraordinary application and a bit of luck.
When such deliveries were bound to come all day along, England were not going to just hang in and bat time. With their approach, it made for a contest, with blows being exchanged constantly. Given the inexperience of their spin attack, the only way England could put some sort of pressure on India was to put up a good total. Winning the toss and batting first, they went in pursuit of it. With the early morning moisture making it for a placid track, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett got the day going with a flurry of boundaries.
The right-left combination sets the tempo and with nothing alarming on the pitch, they freed their arms when they intended. India’s fielders hardly moved when the ball raced past them. Not once during the new-ball spell of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj did they swing across the line. With good bounce on offer, they played through the line. Even when Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin came on, they didn’t panic. A paddle sweep and a conventional sweep fetched two boundaries for Duckett off Jadeja.

Wrestling back control
From there on, Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar took over, keeping the Bazball in check, but giving due respect to it. Having bowled to Duckett without a fielder at cover during the 2016 series, that Ashwin started with one to the left-hander, with protection for a reverse-sweep and a paddle-sweep, showed the well-studied plans of India’s spinners. With a dark dry patch on either side, and the pitch getting baked under the bright sun, they found turn and bounce as Jadeja got rid of Ollie Pope with Rohit Sharma completing a low catch at slips. When Crawley was caught at mid-off off Ashwin, England had lost three wickets in 21 balls.

All eyes were now on how Root and Bairstow would respond. For a side that never seemed to take the pedal off the feet even when wickets fell in a heap previously, here they played the moment, but not once did they drift away from their approach. Be it playing shots or defending, they stuck to their plan, which has worked for them so far.

As Dinesh Karthik has told this daily, Bazball’s ethos is not just about aggressive approach, but to do everything you do with absolute conviction. Similar to how India’s spinners gave due respect, the experienced England reciprocated respect to Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar. Of course, they created opportunities to score boundaries, but at the same time they also defended them with confidence, in a bid to alter their plans. From there it became a battle of patience on either side of lunch before Axar found a way to beat Bairstow.
From there on, Stokes took it upon himself after Root fell a couple of overs later, top-edging a sweep off Jadeja to short fine-leg. He is their perennial man for crisis. He is the sort of player whose approach India have been wary of. Capable of riding the storm or counter-attacking his way out of trouble or shielding the tail and single-handedly playing a game-changing knock, Stokes can do it all with aplomb. When Ben Foakes departed with scoreboard reading 137/6 and a long tail to follow, another opposition in India was on the verge of falling way short of a total that could keep them in the game.

But Stokes would leave his stamp on the game. With Rehan Ahmed, debutant Tom Hartely and Mark Wood playing their part, Stokes would hang in. He would even let Ahmed and Hartley swing for the trees as he hung on waiting for the moment to unleash. Perhaps he was waiting for the challenge to get even harder. He then switch-hit Jadeja for his first boundary, off the 53rd ball he faced. From there on Stokes clobbered his way to a vital 70 before being undone by a Bumrah’s peach as England had 246 on board which Ashwin thought was 30-40 runs more than India liked.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-1st-test-how-bazball-played-out-amidst-the-craft-and-cunning-of-indias-spin-trio-9127765/,sports

"India vs England: Why is it nearly impossible to score big runs against R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel on turning tracks",Former England left-arm spinner Monty Panesar explains to The Indian Express what makes the Indian spin trio more potent compared to bowling units of the visitors,"Monty Panesar’s wicket of Sachin Tendulkar in the 2012 series is probably a dream dismissal for any spinner. The ball pitched on the middle stump and turned sharply to hit the top of the off-stump, while the batter was trying to work the ball on the leg side. The ball after pitching fizzed through giving the batter no time to adjust. The speed gun read 95.4 KPH.
“I think when you are bowling quicker and bowling a good delivery the batter then neither commits forward or back which makes it difficult,” Panesar told The Indian Express. This is where the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been lethal in home conditions. Though there is help from the pitches the Indian trio has been quicker through the air not giving the batters enough time to adjust and then an error in judgment in either picking lines or lengths makes them near impossible to face.
“You can see that Jadeja always bowls quickly early in his spell to get into his spell and afterwards changes the pace,” said Panesar. In addition to bowling quicker through the air Indian spinners tend to be hitting the stumps consistently. “They are going to bowl wicket-to-wicket. I think 35-40 per cent of the deliveries will hit the wickets,” adds the 41-year-old.
Why can’t visiting spinners replicate what Indian spinners do?
Though there is a blueprint for spinners to bowl when in India, which is to bowl quicker through then reaping rewards has been few and far between. “When they are bowling quicker you lose shape (ability to bowl above the batter’s eye line and creating a doubt if he has to come forward or not) on the ball if you want to bowl quicker you still need to have shape on it.”
When bowling quickly spinners might also lose their accuracy resulting in bowling boundary bowls and not letting the pressure pile on Indian batters hence bowling slower balls is preferable for many spinners as it tends to give more control. “When you bowl a bit slower you can get good shape on the ball.” However, Panesar reckons the problem that it brings is that when the ball is slower, the batter has that extra time to adjust even if he misreads the delivery.
“Even if you beat them in the air because there is not much pace of the wicket on Indian pitches even if it spins one can adjust,” he says.

Rishabh Pant’s 91 in the first Test in Chennai 2021 though in a losing cause typified the approach the Indian batters tend to take against the visiting spinners. While there was rough outside the off-stump of the left-hander, every time Jack Leach tried to land the ball on the spot Pant would dance the track and hit him for a maximum not letting the spinner settle down. “Thought I was playing in the IPL!” Leach hilariously said at the time. “As a spinner, you have to expect that at times. But I’m never going to enjoy 8 overs for 80,” he added.
Panesar believes that the aggression shown by Indian batters tends to put a lot of pressure on spinners. “They don’t want the spinners to bowl with a good shape on it, good dip, good drop. That’s the danger ball for the Indian batters. So they will come after you so that you fire it in, just bowl into the pitch and don’t put that shape on it. And it is easier to pick the length and then they will milk you all day.”

Kevin Pietersen’s 186 in Mumbai is arguably one of the best counter-attacking innings a visiting batter has played on Indian soil. The batter made 338 runs at an average of 48.29 back then. While he was looking to take on the spinners, the inexperience of Ashwin and tired legs of Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha had no answer to the assault throughout the series.

Fast forward over a decade, there has been significant change. Joe Root is technically one of the sound batters against spin bowling. He can rotate the strike at will and can bring out the sweep shot and make the bowlers re-think their strategy and not let the bowlers settle down. When he made the magnificent double ton in Chennai, his method worked like a well-oiled machine. However, post that the batter was not allowed to sweep at all. “The sweep shot is a lot easier when the spinner bowls it a bit slower. Cause when you bowl slower you can reach out for the ball,” Panesar would theorize.
“They are also very creative Ashwin and Jadeja are always changing the fieldsets. They always have different tactics and different game plans so that the batters cannot settle,” the former England spinner said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-why-is-it-nearly-impossible-to-score-big-runs-against-ravichandran-ashwin-ravindra-jadeja-and-axar-patel-on-turning-tracks-9127165/,sports

Sathiyan focusing on mixed doubles with Manika Batra in Olympics lead-up as singles too tough,"However, training time with Manika limited as both have separate schedules and academies.","A WTT Star Contender held in India is where star paddler G Sathiyan would normally want to give his all and take advantage of home comforts to reach the tournament’s later rounds and improve his world ranking.
Since 2019, he’s been driven to maintain his place among the top 50 in the world, with entering the top 20 his ultimate target.
On Wednesday at the WTT Star Contender Goa at the Peddem Indoor Stadium in Mapusa though, there was a shock in store for him. He’s used to being in the main draw of singles events, but low ranking meant he had to go through qualifying after not getting a wildcard. He won his first round of qualifiers, but then suffered a shock 3-2 (7-11, 11-7, 6-11, 11-7, 8-11) loss to World No.194 Vincent Picard in a topsy-turvy match.
Normally, he would be distraught after such a loss, but Sathiyan just shook off the disappointment, came to the practice arena, and asked his mixed doubles partner, India’s top-ranked women’s paddler Manika Batra, when she was free to train.
“I’m definitely giving more importance to mixed doubles in the lead-up to the Olympics. It’s ok that my singles ranking has been going down,” said Sathiyan, who has dropped to World No. 94.
The Olympics have mixed doubles as a separate category and the Sathiyan-Manika pair, ranked No.11 in the world, is poised to qualify for the Paris Games. Ever since they started playing together in 2021, they’ve had a phenomenal run, beaten top opponents, and even reached as high as World No.5 at one point. It makes them serious medal contenders in the French capital.
“We have a fair chance and an Olympic medal is an Olympic medal. You win that and it could change the face of the game. I wanted to focus on mixed doubles more where we have a chance in Paris. So Manika and I are trying hard. We aren’t in great shape right now but know that one win can change anything. Two wins in Paris and we win a medal. Right now my goal is that,” Sathiyan told The Indian Express.
Right after Olympics!

He also has no qualms in admitting that he’s choosing mixed doubles over singles as he doesn’t stand a chance of medalling in the latter event.

“To be honest, it will be very difficult to win a medal in singles. I’ve participated once, maybe I could go two rounds further but still, you are two to three rounds away from a medal chance. I have to accept I am not as physically strong as the top athletes. My game is not that high yet and so it’s better I concentrate on something where I stand a chance at winning,” he said.
The conundrum
Though he’s nursing knee and lower back injuries and physiotherapists have advised him to rest, Sathiyan says that the World Table Tennis (WTT) calendar has become so packed that taking a break could hurt his chances of qualifying. That’s why he is only choosing to play mixed doubles at top-tier events instead of trying to improve his singles ranking.
“I missed a lot of WTT Feeder events – which could’ve been beneficial for my singles ranking — in favour of playing mixed doubles at Contender and Star Contender events. I had to take a call as my body isn’t allowing me to play everything,” he says.
Sathiyan says that the World Table Tennis (WTT) calendar has become so packed that taking a break could hurt his chances of qualifying. (File)
While Sathiyan has given up hope of qualifying in singles, Manika is likely to make it to the main draw of the Olympics and has to continue playing top events to keep her spot. It means they barely get any time to train together but Sathiyan says it’s imperative they find a way to do so.

“We’ve barely trained together for a total of 15 days in the last year. We’re trying to have a more robust training schedule. It’s not that easy because she has a personal coach and I also have mine. We have occasions when we’ve trained together in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai. Right now, all we can manage is short camps of 4-5 days,” he says, adding that having a national centre where they can train anytime would be hugely beneficial for the national team. It would allow them to train with their partners whenever they want rather than having to coordinate with their respective academies and coaches to book training slots.

"Australian Open 2024: New doubles No.1 Rohan Bopanna credits composure, ‘Iyengar’ yoga, focus on recovery for reaching summit at age 43","Bopanna would become the fourth Indian - after Sania Mirza, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi - to become doubles World No.1.","At the end of the 2022 season, with Rohan Bopanna well into his forties with his career seemingly having seen its peak, there were not many options left in the locker room for the doubles veteran to pick a partner. As he puts it, the collaboration with Australia’s Matthew Ebden, at a similar crossroads in his career, was born out of both necessity and a mutual connection.
The duo became an instant hit, not only revitalising their careers, but also taking each other to the summit of the sport. On Wednesday, after their straight-sets win over the sixth-seeded Argentinian pair of Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni, Bopanna became the oldest World No.1 in history at the age of 43, taking the top spot in the men’s doubles rankings for the first time in his career. Ebden will be right behind him with the same number of ranking points but fewer tournaments played, when the updated list appears on Monday.
The duo’s latest achievements follow a landmark 2023, when they won the Indian Wells Masters and reached four other Masters finals, culminating in the US Open final they lost despite leading by a set.
Bopanna-Ebden may not be the most typical of pairings, but where their playing styles are most complementary, according to the man from Coorg, is the laid-back composure with which they handle pressure situations.

“The biggest strength is that both of us are very calm on court, no matter what the situation is. That comes in with a lot of experience, He’s (Ebden) been playing a long time, competing at a high level and winning Grand Slams,” Bopanna told reporters from Melbourne on Tuesday. “He understands the value of the right kind of strategy for these kinds of matches. We have been able to combine our mental strengths to win tough, close matches.”
And true to form in their latest match at least, the Indo-Australian duo never buckled under pressure in their nearly two-hour-long win that was trickier than the scoreline suggested. It was a fleeting opportunity in the fifth game of the first set on Gonzalez’s serve when they found the break. From there, they looked unfazed, suffering just one break point for the rest of the match, consistently applying pressure on their opponents’ serves even if they could not fashion another break, and not buckling during the second-set tiebreaker to round out the 6-4, 7-6 (5) win.
Keeping at it
Bopanna would become the fourth Indian – after Sania Mirza, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi – to become doubles World No.1.
“Extremely proud of the fact that I have been able to complete my dream,” Bopanna would later say. “It has been a little over a decade since I was World No.3. So truly proud to have made it happen.”
Age is just a number & no one proves it better than Bopsy😍🥳

The Indian, a veteran of more than 40 Davis Cup ties, is full of pride that most of his achievements these days are prefixed with the word ‘oldest’.

“Nobody reaches the World No.1 ranking without consistency. It’s not an overnight achievement. It always comes after successive tournaments, doing well week in, week out. That’s what I was able to do in 2023,” he said.
Bopanna says his late-career resurgence, aided by an adoption of ‘Iyengar’ yoga and dedicated focus on recovery, has led to more consistent results than he has ever had in his career.
“You need to be disciplined as an athlete,” the 43-year-old said. “For example, the first day I landed in Australia was January 4. Since then, till today, every single day I have gone and taken an ice bath, whether it is after practice or a match or whatever. Because at my age, recovery is a major aspect before anything else comes into play. Having access to these things, to physios, the improvements in sports science, all have made a massive difference in my career.”
World No.1 ranking in tow, Bopanna will qualify for the Paris Olympics if he keeps his place in the top 10 of the rankings over the next six months, ensuring Indian representation in tennis at the Summer Games that seems unlikely otherwise.

India vs England: Can Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer fill the void left by Virat Kohli?,"IND vs ENG: In Kohli’s absence, it’s even important for them to shoulder responsibility and score big runs","On Tuesday, Shubman Gill was named India’s men cricketer of 2023. On Wednesday, a day before India’s first Test against England, he turned up for a full-on nets session at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. It’s a rare sight because most first-eleven regulars skip the match-eve practice session. Mostly, only the back-ups turn up, more in the hope of an opportunity opening up at the last minute.
But few batsmen in India’s line-up, weakened by the absence of Virat Kohli, would be as under pressure as Gill could be. So he slogged for a good couple of hours in the nets under the unusually searing January sun. After starting off against seamers, he quickly shifted to facing the spinners (all net bowlers). Having struggled in the past against off-spinners, he would seek one out and instruct him to bowl a bit slower through the air as he alternated between attack and defence. There were times when he was beaten on the outside edge. Gill would often respond with an aggressive shot.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-can-gill-and-iyer-fill-the-virat-void-9125985/,sports

This comes after the British Prime Minister got involved in the matter and there was much outrage in that country’s media.
A source in India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed that Bashir had been granted a visa on his return to the United Kingdom. It is also learnt that the reason his application got cleared much later than the other members of the England team was his Pakistani origin.

While India has been dominant in the home Tests for over a decade now they will be facing a challenge like never before with the England team under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum at the helm looking to change the formula of how Test matches should be approached which is to play attacking cricket.
England was the last team to beat India in 2012 under Alastair Cook. However, that team relied more on playing the orthodox way and grind out the results. This one is more on the flamboyant side of the spectrum and would come all guns blazing at the Indian side.

If one further breaks down the stats, India have lost just three Tests out of 44 they played in their own backyard in this phase, and this is a power walk even beyond the all-conquering West Indies in the ’80s or Australia of the turn of the century. Several factors have contributed to this astonishing run over the last decade, including favourable pitches, bowlers who knew how to exploit those tracks and batters who churned out runs like popcorn from a vending machine.

India vs England: Ben Stokes picks three spinners in playing XI for 1st IND vs ENG Test in Hyderabad,Ben Foakes will be playing as the wicket-keeper and Jonny Bairstow will replace Harry Brook in the middle order,"England announced their playing eleven for the first Test at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad a day before the Test. The visitors have picked three spinners in their lineup and one pacer in Mark Wood. Left-arm spinners Jack Leach and Tom Hartley addition to leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed are included in the playing eleven.
Monty Panesar speaking to this Newspaper would rate young Hartley highly and compare him to Axar Patel, “He’s a similar bowler to Axar. He is more of a roller. Axar knows he doesn’t have to put much spin on it. He looks to set the batter up to the non-turning delivery. And then you’ll get the odd one because his seam is slightly squarer, he’ll get that ball to bite that little bit. Not as sharp as Jadeja. That’s why they complement each other. One’s tall, the other one is a bit shorter.”

‘Indian tennis needed this’: Rohan Bopanna to become oldest World No 1 at 43 after reaching Australian Open semis,"Bopanna will thus become only the fourth Indian after Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza to take the world number one rank in doubles.","Indian tennis ace Rohan Bopanna will be crowned as the World No 1 in men’s doubles after reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open along with his partner Matthew Ebden on Wednesday. Bopanna will be the oldest player to become World No 1, beating the record set by USA’s Rajeev Ram, who reached the ranking summit in October 2022 at the age of 38.
The 43-year-old Bopanna paired with Ebden to brush aside the sixth seeds from Argentina Máximo González and Andrés Molteni in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (5) in a quarterfinal that lasted an hour and 46 minutes. Up next for Bopanna and Ebden are the unseeded Tomas Machac and Zhizhen Zhang.

“It’s been an incredible 20 years playing this tournament week in, week out, and today, reaching the No 1 ranking, it’s an extremely amazing and proud feeling. It probably hasn’t sunk in fully yet but still credit to the entire team. These last 13 months have been an incredibly consistent kind of a year. I am proud to be where I am today, at the ranking of no. 1. So, India needed this, Indian tennis needed this. I am really happy to be representing India across the world in this tennis journey. There’s so much love and support from the entire country for two decades. I am thankful for all the support. I think, this is from my side, giving back to everyone in India,” Bopanna was quoted as saying after his quarter-final victory.
“World No.1 looks good on you, Bopsy. Thanks for always inspiring us,” tweeted Sumit Nagal, who himself scripted history at the ongoing Australian Open after reaching the second round by defeating 27th seed Alexander Bublik, thereby becoming the first Indian since Ramesh Krishnan in 1989 to beat a seeded player in the singles main draw of a Grand Slam.
In the past, Bopanna has claimed the mixed doubles title at the French Open in 2017 partnering Canada’s Gabriela Dabrowski. But in men’s doubles at Grand Slams, he has come close to securing it twice, before narrowly missing out: he was the runner-up at the US Open in 2010 with Pakistan’s Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and with Ebden last year (where he had become the oldest-ever Grand Slam finalist).
It must be noted that Bopanna is the oldest player to claim a men’s doubles title at a Masters 1000 event: achieving the feat in 2023, aged 43, when he paired with Ebden to win the prestigious Indian Wells tournament.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/indian-tennis-needed-this-rohan-bopanna-to-become-oldest-world-no-1-at-43-after-reaching-australian-open-semis-9125039/,sports
"AFC Asian Cup: India finish pointless, goalless but coach Igor Stimac says ‘we can compete at this level’",Syria hand third straight defeat at the continental tournament as team’s toothless ‘attack’ at this level exposed,"Three games, over 270 minutes of football, six goals conceded, none scored and no points earned – India’s campaign at the 2023 AFC Asian Cup came to an underwhelming end on Tuesday with the team succumbing to a 1-0 loss to Syria at the Al Bayt Stadium in Doha.
The final 10 minutes of the game were a sight to behold – eerily similar to how the curtain came crashing down for the men’s football team at the Asian Games. It was a group of 11 chasing, harrying and finally winning the ball, only to have every good idea come to naught with no final ball and an end product. The lack of options when presented with the ball and helplessness at the continental level has been a resounding theme around the two teams Igor Stimac has taken to the two big assignments at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024.

The two teams will also play Neymar's Al-Hilal.,"Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr have cancelled their two-game China tour after the forward suffered an injury, the Saudi club said on Tuesday, sparking concern over the Portuguese’s participation in their upcoming encounter against Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami.
Al-Nassr were scheduled to play Shanghai Shenhua on Jan. 24 and Zhejiang four days later, with both games now postponed.
“We are willing to complete our training camp as planned in Shenzhen, a city that has warmly welcomed us and shown so much love for us and our Captain,” Al-Nassr said in a statement.
“Furthermore, we have agreed with the organizer to schedule a new match as soon as possible.”
The 38-year-old Ronaldo apologised to fans as he confirmed he was struggling with a fitness issue.
“I have played for 22 years and I am a player that doesn’t have too many injuries. So I’m really sad because Al-Nassr and myself have come to China to enjoy the tour,” Ronaldo said.
“We have not cancelled the game, we want to push for the game and be back here… Unfortunately, I have some problem, but this is part of football and my life.”

"IND vs ENG: ‘No ultra-attacking, our batsmen are attacking by nature,’ says Rahul Dravid on Bazball","While India may not adopt an ultra-aggressive approach, their bowlers will definitely be tested by one from England.","Ahead of Test series it is quite common to hear about coaches speaking about batting approaches. Some demand them to show intent. Some back their players to go aggressive. There are instances where they are told to be bold. And then there is the entire Bazball approach, which has even managed to find a place in Collins dictionary. As India are set to embrace the Bazball challenge at home starting Thursday, India head coach Rahul Dravid’s message to the batting group was rather simple: play to the situation.
Ever since Bazball took Test cricket by storm, other teams have been faced with this question as to whether they would be tempted to adopt the same approach. With India set to roll out turners — where invariably a ball with your name on it could arrive any moment – adopting an aggressive approach with the bat has helped batsmen get out of jail. In fact, last time England visited India, Rohit Sharma’s century in the first innings at Chennai (second Test) proved to be a game-changer.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-no-ultra-attacking-our-batsmen-are-attacking-by-nature-says-rahul-dravid-on-bazball-9124487/,sports

That’s the grand total of Test matches Rehan Ahmed, Shoaib Bashir and Tom Hartley have played between each other. The first class outings of the trio doesn’t even add up to 40. And yet, it is them that England have entrusted – alongside Jack Leach – for the most daunting challenge in all of bilateral cricket – a Test series in India. This, against a team which has Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel in attendance.
Former England spinner Monty Panesar, who played a crucial hand with 17 wickets in England’s triumphant Test series in India in 2012, reckons playing in these conditions may also be the greatest advantage for the novice spinners. And that it would fit in with the Bazball plan.

IND vs ENG: India enter Bazball Universe with concerns about efficacy of turning tracks,"As the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India.","It has been nearly 12 years since India lost a Test series at home. Since Alastair Cook’s England rallied to defeat them 2-1 in a four-match series, India have won 16 on the bounce – a feat that not even the all-conquering West Indies and Australia sides of the past – could come close. For 12 years, with a core of their XI remaining intact, they have looked truly invincible, having lost only three Tests at home. Beginning with Michael Clarke in 2013 to Pat Cummins in 2023, 14 captains have made attempts to win a series here. And among them only Steve Smith, Joe Root and Cummins have at least managed to win a Test here.
As the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India. Like in 2012, when Andy Flower and Cook masterminded a sensational series win, defeating the hosts in their own game, India are a team in transition. And for the first two Tests in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, they will also be without Virat Kohli, meaning they will have the combined experience of their No 3, 4, 5, 6 will be only 86 Tests. And making it the most complicated for them is the Bazball approach from England, which is making them ponder over a lot.
While India have mostly preferred to play on turners since the World Test Championship came into picture, ahead of the England series there is an element of doubt if they stick to the same formula. Under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, England have binned all conventions associated with Test cricket. The concept of following something just because it has been the norm before doesn’t exist in the Bazball universe.
Despite breaking barriers, there are already questions flying from all directions in the Old Blighty if England are stretching it too far. For a series of this significance, they landed in India only on Sunday night and have just three training sessions before they take the field in Hyderabad. In Bazball universe, all the preparations for a gruelling India tour happened at Abu Dhabi from mid-January.
There is a rationale, not just bravado behind it. They feared that India might serve batting tracks with a second-string attack against them in practice games. And even if there was a turning track, it’s said that they feared the scenario where batsmen get out cheaply without facing many balls and are mopping around on the field without much practice. Instead, in Abu Dhabi, they have gone about training on custom-made tracks, working on a batting routine they hope to adopt in the Tests.
Plenty of questions for India
In the 24 matches since McCullum took over and has redefined how England play Test cricket, they have an overall strike-rate of 75.48 with the bat. In the same period, India’s is 54.57 and Australia 54.14.
This approach, where England’s batting unit never takes the pedal off, has put opposition bowlers off guard. The noise and buzz around it only adds to their aura. From having just one win out of 17 before McCullum and Stokes took charge, they have now won 13 in the next 18, including three in Pakistan and one in New Zealand. So this isn’t confined to home. Of course, the upcoming five in India will be a stern test, especially in conditions where the Bazball is yet to be tested.

And it is this unknown element that is making India fret a bit. They are blinded as to what to expect and are huddled in conversations. All things point to India playing on a turner in Hyderabad, but it is understood that this could well turn into a series where the hosts will take stock match after match. While India will heavily rely on the spin trio of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, unlike the past there are deliberations if playing on turners could close the gap between the two sides, especially given India’s brittle middle-order.
On turning pitches, apart from toss becoming a crucial factor, it is one quick-fire innings from a batsman that has proved to be a big difference. It is the approach that even India’s batsmen are known to take on such conditions before they rely on the trio of spinners to do their job with the bat. However, with this high-risk game being England’s bread and butter, with their No 1 to No 11 following it to the T, there is more reason to be fearful of this approach as the game could unravel far more quickly than India have experienced at home.

With all the venues having black soil pitches, for now India believe the lack of bounce and pace off the pitch could keep England’s batting in check. Such tracks where the batting unit have to force the pace could also unsettle England’s plans of playing taller batsmen – long reach against spinners – to an extent.
There were even deliberations whether India should go back to their traditional flat decks, which they used to great success during the 2016/17 season where they defeated New Zealand, England and Australia. But even that comes with its own risk element, especially with Bazball. Apart from toss being a factor as batting last on a deteriorating surface could be quite risky, the Bazball has thrived especially in such conditions. Even back home in England, they have moved on from playing on green tracks, instead opting for flat decks that suit England’s stroke-makers.

“I don’t really relate to the term Bazball,” Jasprit Bumrah would tell Guardian. “But they are playing successful cricket and the aggressive route of taking the opposition on, showing the world there’s another way to play Test cricket. As a bowler, what I think is that it keeps me in play. And if they’re going for it, playing so fast, they won’t tire me out, I could get heaps [of wickets]. I always think about how I can use things to my advantage. Kudos to them but, as a bowler, you’re in the game.” Well, that’s one way to look at it, but there are concerns for India.
That they are facing their biggest ever test in over a decade without their best batsman makes it all the more interesting. Of course, given the calibre of India’s spinners which also includes Kuldeep Yadav, there is still every reason to believe they can extend their unbeaten streak at home. That Australia managed to keep the Bazball in check until Nathan Lyon was around at the Ashes last year would make India all the more hopeful, provided their batting unit steps up without their best Test batsman.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-india-enter-bazball-universe-with-concerns-about-efficacy-of-turning-tracks-9122553/,sports

Unlocking the science of E Ink displays: Why we believe they must catch on,That e-reader screen isn't magic - it's E Ink! We break down the science behind these paper-like displays.,"With their crisp, paper-like screens, e-readers like the Kindle are a pleasure to read on. But how do these E Ink displays actually work, and what makes them different from your phone or laptop screen? We unlock the science behind these ingenious displays and explore why E Ink still hasn’t conquered all our screens despite its advantages.
What are E Ink displays and how do they work?
E Ink displays are a special type of screen technology often used in e-readers like the Amazon Kindle. The technology was originally developed in the 1990s at MIT and is now owned by E Ink Corporation.
The screens work using tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black ones suspended in fluid inside the display. By applying positive or negative electrical charges to different areas of the screen, the white or black particles can be made to rise to the surface, creating the text and images on the display.
How E Ink works. (Image: E Ink Holdings)
Unlike LCD and LED displays that use a backlight, E Ink displays reflect light – just like paper. This makes them easier on the eyes for long reading sessions. They also require very little power since they don’t need a backlight and only use energy when the image changes. The lack of backlighting also means that they are easier to read under brighter lighting conditions, which isn’t the case with LCD/LED displays at all – legibility actually takes a hit under bright sunlight.
How is E Ink different from E Paper?
E Ink and E Paper may sound like the same thing, but they actually refer to different display technologies. E Paper is a broad term for any display designed to mimic the appearance of real paper. Meanwhile, E Ink is a specific type of E Paper display that uses millions of tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid.
Since E Ink displays are not backlit, they may feature LEDs around the display to help you read in the dark. (Image: Amazon)
An excellent example of a device with an E Paper display but not an E Ink display is the Pebble smartwatch. This cool gadget uses a low-power LCD with a reflective layer to look like paper, which is a very different implementation from E Ink.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of E Ink displays?
E Ink displays have several key advantages that make them well-suited for certain applications. First, they consume very little power compared to LCD and OLED displays. An E Ink display only draws power when the image is changed, meaning it can display a static image for weeks or months without needing a charge. This makes it ideal for e-readers and other devices meant for long battery life.

Second, E Ink displays cause less eye strain for the user. The lack of a backlight and the paper-like visual experience mean users can read on an E Ink device for hours without fatigue. The matte surface and high contrast also make them easily readable outdoors and under bright light.

However, E Ink displays also have some downsides. The biggest is their slow refresh rate compared to LCD and OLED displays. While improvements have been made, such Ink displays still take much longer to refresh, making them unsuitable for video or animation. E Ink also has limitations on colour and resolution compared to other display technologies. And the niche nature of E Ink manufacturing means the displays remain expensive, especially in larger sizes. This limits their use to mostly e-readers and a handful of other products where their particular advantages outweigh higher cost.
Therefore, for the majority of display applications demanding speed, responsiveness and high resolution, LCDs and OLEDs remain superior to E Ink alternatives. But for a subset of use cases valuing long battery life, outdoor visibility and eye comfort, they retain unique benefits over other display tech.
What are the uses of E Ink displays?
E Ink first hit the scene in the early 2000s and was all the rage among e-readers like the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and Sony Reader. Folks loved it because the text was super clear even in bright sunlight. You can still find E Ink displays on Kindle and Kobo e-readers today, though other screen tech has taken over much of the e-reader market.

E Ink made brief appearances in a few early cell phones before getting replaced by fancier displays. But with its easy reading and lower distraction factor, some startups are exploring E Ink in smartphones. A cool example is the BlackBerry-like Minimal Phone, currently crowdfunding, which aims to cut down screen time and help users focus on communication and productivity.

Beyond mobile devices, E Ink is popping up around a few cities on stuff like bus stop displays and walking direction signs. Some restaurants are using E Ink menu boards too. Unlike glossy LCDs that create glare and reflections, such displays feature a matte surface that’s more natural-looking and readable at angles and under different lighting.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/e-ink-displays-why-they-should-catch-on-9129270/,technology

Nintendo Switching things up? Leaks suggest larger 8″ screen for next-gen console,Rumour has it the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 will be equipped with a sizable 8-inch LCD screen.,"Rumours are heating up that Nintendo may unveil a successor to its popular Switch console later this year. According to a new prediction by Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase, the so-called “Nintendo Switch 2” could launch in 2024 with an 8-inch LCD screen, representing a sizable increase over the 6.2-inch and 7-inch displays found on the original Switch and Switch OLED models respectively.
Hayase based his forecast on supply chain research focused on small and medium sized displays. He believes demand from Nintendo for larger screens suitable for a Switch successor will cause shipments of amusement displays to double next year.
Neither Nintendo nor its partners have officially confirmed the existence of a Switch 2. However, Bloomberg has reported that Hayase is not alone in predicting an upgraded Nintendo console to hit shelves in 2024.
Speculation around a new Nintendo platform has swirled for many months, with signs pointing to its unveiling this year. There are reports that Nintendo privately showcased the Switch 2 to developers at Gamescom 2023.
Details on the Switch 2’s technical specifications remain uncertain and conflicting. Some leaks point to a new Nvidia Tegra processor, while others expect Nintendo to use an 8nm chipset from Samsung rather than a 5nm node.
The Switch 2 is expected to support 4K visuals and run at 60 frames per second, a significant boost over the original Switch’s max 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second target. Breath of the Wild 2 and tech demos based on Unreal Engine 5 are rumoured to have already been tested on prototype Switch 2 developer hardware.
Of course, fans eagerly awaiting the next generation of Nintendo gaming will have to wait for official word direct from Nintendo before getting too excited. But analysts clearly believe the company is poised to capitalise on the original Switch’s success with new hardware in 2024.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/nintendo-switch-may-get-8-inch-screen-lcd-screen-9129128/,technology
Epic’s Fortnite and new browser engines show cracks in Apple’s walled garden,The EU's antitrust regulations are forcing Apple to open iOS to competition like Fortnite and alternate browser engines.,"Apple is continuing to open up iOS to comply with new regulations from the European Union. Not only is the company enabling alternate browser engines on iOS for the first time ever, but Epic Games has also announced the eventual return of Fortnite to the platform.
Epic Games revealed it plans to launch the Epic Games Store on iOS devices and bring Fortnite back to the platform later this year, but only in Europe. Fortnite has been unavailable on iOS since 2020 when it was banned for violating App Store policies around in-app purchases.
The return of Fortnite marks a major shift for Apple’s traditionally closed ecosystem. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney described Apple’s new rules allowing third-party app stores as “hot garbage” but said the company will take advantage of them regardless.
The rules stem from the EU’s Digital Markets Act intended to rein in anti-competitive behavior from major tech companies like Apple. Part of the regulations require that users have the ability to uninstall pre-installed apps like Safari.
Complementing this change, iOS 17.4 will for the first time allow alternate browser engines beyond just Apple’s own WebKit. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge have historically been forced to run on WebKit for iOS due to Apple’s restrictions.
Now, with iOS 17.4 which rolls out next month, developers can apply to use alternate engines like Chromium and Gecko. This will enable full functionality and extension support for third-party browsers available on iOS in Europe.
Both these developments represent a blow to the walls of Apple’s walled garden. While falling short of fully opening iOS, they demonstrate Apple bending its strict App Store policies in order to comply with the DMA.
ADVERTISEMENT
The DMA aims to give users more choice over their devices and create a more level playing field between Apple and small developers. Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney said these goals are undermined by the restrictions Apple still has in place like its commission on in-app purchases.
Nonetheless, the return of Fortnite and availability of alternate browsers are milestones in increased competition on iOS. It remains to be seen whether Apple will expand these allowances globally in the face of similar regulatory pressure elsewhere. For now, European iOS users will enjoy options long desired but forbidden by Apple’s tight control over its ecosystem.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/epic-fortnite-return-browser-engines-apple-ios-9129067/,technology
Hubble finds water vapour on small exoplanet in landmark discovery,Scientists have used the Hubble Space Telescope to discover the presence of water on a distant exoplanet. This makes GJ 9827d the smallest exoplanet where we have discovered water.,"Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to find evidence of water vapour in the atmosphere of the planet GJ 9827d. Even though the planet is twice as wide as the Earth, it is the smallest exoplanet where astronomers have found evidence of water so far.
The Max Planck Institute for Astronomy announced the discovery on Thursday. “This would be the first time that we can directly show through atmospheric detection, that these planets with water-rich atmospheres can actually exist around other stars. This is an important step toward determining the prevalence and diversity of atmospheres on rocky planets,” said research team member Björn Benneke in a press statement.
But before you jump the gun and imagine the possibility of life on the planet, do note that it is as hot as Venus, which will make a Delhi summer pale in comparison. What is important about the discovery is that the aging Hubble was used to determine the presence of water on such a (relatively) small exoplanet, opening up many new avenues for scientists.
But on the other hand, it is still too early for the scientists to conclude whether Hubble measured a small amount of water vapour on a planet with a puffy hydrogen-rick atmosphere or if the atmosphere itself is mostly made of water that was left behind a primeval hydrogen/helium atmosphere that evaporated in the intense radiation of a star.
But since the planet is around six billion years old and so close to its host star, scientists are leaning towards the latter possibility since it should have lost most of its primordial hydrogen due to stellar radiation.
In the end, the research team is left with two possibilities — either the planet is still clinging to its hydrogen-rich atmosphere, which will make it a mini-Neptune; or it is a warmer version of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which has twice as much water as our planet under its crust.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/hubble-exoplanet-water-9128948/,technology
James Webb Space Telescope takes stunning image of stars being born,"The James Webb Space Telescope captured this stunning image of a ""star-forming factory"" in deep space.","The James Webb Space Telescope took this stunning image of a star-forming nebula called N79, which is a region of ionised interstellar atomic hydrogen. The nebula is in the H II region of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and was captured by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).
N79 is simply a humongous star-forming celestial region that spans around 1,630 light-years and is in the southwest region of LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). It is regarded as the younger version of the Tarantula Nebula (officially known as 30 Doradus). However, scientists estimate that N79 has a star formation efficiency that far exceeds the Tarantula Nebula.
This image, in particular, focuses on one of three giant molecular clouds complex called N79 South or S1. The star-shaped pattern that you can see here is a series of diffraction spikes. Just like most other telescopes, Webb uses a mirror to collect light. The design of the mirror on the telescope causes this artifact.
The six largest “star spikes” that you can see in the image are caused by the hexagonal symmetry of the Webb telescope’s 18 primary mirror segments. These sorts of patterns are usually most visible around very bright and compact objects where a lot of light comes from the same place. Even though most galaxies appear very small to our eyes, they are much more spread out than a single star and thus do not cause this pattern.
This particular image centres on one of the three giant molecular cloud complexes, dubbed N79 South (S1 for short). The distinct ‘starburst’ pattern surrounding this bright object is a series of diffraction spikes. All telescopes that use a mirror to collect light, as Webb does, have this form of artifact that arises from the design of the telescope. In Webb’s case, the six largest starburst spikes appear because of the hexagonal symmetry of Webb’s 18 primary mirror segments. Patterns like these are only noticeable around very bright, compact objects, where all the light comes from the same place. Most galaxies, even though they appear very small to our eyes, are darker and more spread out than a single star, and therefore do not show this pattern.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/james-webb-space-telescope-n79-9128830/,technology
OpenAI fixes ‘lazy’ GPT-4 Turbo model and drops pricing,OpenAI slashes prices for GPT-3.5 Turbo and boosts GPT-4 Turbo performance.,"OpenAI has released several updates to its AI models and pricing, marking the latest in a series of incremental improvements by the research company. The changes include lower pricing for its popular GPT-3.5 Turbo model, a performance boost for GPT-4 Turbo, and upgraded text embedding models.
Most notably, OpenAI has cut the per-token pricing of GPT-3.5 Turbo by 50% for input and 25% for output. This model powers applications like ChatGPT and serves as an industry benchmark for conversational AI. Lower prices make the API more accessible for developers building text-intensive products that require analysing documents or books. With open-source models catching up to OpenAI, reduced pricing helps retain customers.
GPT-3.5 Turbo also gains a new version 0125 with unspecified “improvements.” Since the last iteration was 0613, some may have expected more details on advancements from OpenAI.
For GPT-4 Turbo, a new preview model 0125 arrives that OpenAI says “completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly” to reduce “laziness” where the model avoids finishing work. This fix aims to boost performance on technical tasks compared to previous versions. GPT-4 with vision capabilities remains in preview but will launch more broadly in coming months.
On the technical side, upgraded text embedding models provide better semantic representations of language for researchers and engineers.
While not earth-shattering, OpenAI’s latest tweaks reflect the company’s iterative approach to enhancing its AI lineup.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-fixes-lazy-gpt-4-model-and-drops-pricing-9128794/,technology
Road ends for NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter due to rotor damage,"NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was the first to prove that powered, controlled flight is possible on worlds other than Earth but it can no longer carry on with its mission because of damage to its rotors.","NASA on Thursday said its history-making Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s mission has come to an end after its rotor blades took on damage during landing. It was originally designed as a technology demonstration to complete five test flights over 30 days but it far exceeded that expectation by completing 72 flights over a period of three years.
“The historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end. That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best – make the impossible possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a press statement.
The rotorcraft landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, secured within the Perseverance rover. It took off on its first flight on April 19 that year, marking the first time that any aircraft achieved powered controlled flight on a world other than Earth. It dispatched its next four flights quickly as well, completing its original mission. After that, NASA engineers began using Ingenuity as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover.
Fast forward to 2024, the Ingenuity team at the space agency was planning to make a short vertical hop on January 18 to determine its exact location after an emergency landing during a previous flight. Telemetry data showed that it achieved its maximum altitude of 12 metres and hovered for 4.5 seconds before it started descending with a velocity of about one metre per second.
But once the helicopter was about a metre above the surface, it lost contact with Perseverance. Since Perseverance acts as a communication relay between the helicopter and Earth, this meant that mission controllers lost touch with the rotorcraft. Communications were reestablished the following day.
Images of Ingenuity taken by Perseverance reveal revealed the damage to the rotorblade but the reason for the communication dropouts and the orientation of the rotorcraft at the time of touchdown are still being investigated to find out exactly what happened.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-9128734/,technology

"Google introduces Lumiere, a multimodal AI video model: Is this the future of filmmaking?","Google recently dropped its AI text-to-video model, Lumiere. The results are putting existing models to the test.","Google just announced its latest AI video model that is capable of creating realistic, diverse, and coherent motion. Known as Lumiere, the latest offering from Google is a text-to-video and image-to-video model. In simple words, you input text or image and the AI neural networks translate it into a video. Based on recent reports, Lumiere is much beyond the simple text-to-video functionality.
The tool allows users to animate existing images, and create videos in the format of an input image or painting. It also allows video in painting and creating specific animation in sections within an image.
How does Lumiere create videos?
Google’s research titled ‘Lumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation’ offers the scientific details behind Lumiere. “We introduce Lumiere – a text-to-video diffusion model designed for synthesizing videos that portray realistic, diverse, and coherent motion – a pivotal challenge in video synthesis. To this end, we introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model,” reads the opening lines of the abstract.
ICYMI | Best AI tools of 2023: ChatGPT rules the roost, followed by Google Bard, Midjourney, and more
The main innovation here is the SpaceTime Diffusion model that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once. In contrast, existing AI video models synthesize distant key frames one at a time. With Lumiere, Google aims to offer global temporal consistency ensuring coherent representation across different frames.
In the research paper, the capabilities of Lumiere have been demonstrated through various examples. Based on the output, the text-to-video results show some promising consistency and accuracy in portraying diverse scenes. Meanwhile, the image-to-video transformations too seem to show impressive animations. Further, the model’s stylised generation using reference images also produces visually appealing and coherent results.
Lumiere text-to-video demo as cited in the research paper.
According to the researchers, the text-to-video generation framework has been introduced using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion. Since existing methods were struggling with globally coherent motion, the team addressed this by deploying a space-time U-Net architecture that directly generates full-frame-rate video clips, incorporating spatial and temporal modules. Resultantly, their approach showed superior results in image-to-video, video inpainting, and stylised generation.

Why does it matter?
In the paper, the team compares the performance of the AI model with other state-of-the-art models in the industry that are known for their superior performance in text-to-video and image-to-video generation. Based on the results, Lumiere seems to outperform in terms of video quality as well as text alignment.
While this model may create a buzz with its incredible capabilities, its potential use case could essentially be enabling individuals to create Hollywood-style slick movies with ease. The AI community has been exploring how these models could generate images and videos and the development of world models for advanced simulations. Lumiere seems to be paving way for more advancements and research. It is a significant leap in AI-driven video synthesis, offering vast creative possibilities. The consistent and realistic results displayed in the examples indicate the potential for transformative advancements in the field of AI-generated content.
In conclusion, the team stated that their primary goal in this work is to enable novice users to generate visual content creatively and flexibly. They admitted that there is a risk of misuse for creating fake or harmful content with this new technology. “We believe that it is crucial to develop and apply tools for detecting biases and malicious use cases to ensure safe and fair use,” read the research paper.
It needs to be noted that as of now, there is no way to access or download Lumiere. However, experts feel that Lumiere will enhance Google Bard’s multimodal capabilities in the future. There is so far no official acknowledgment that the AI model will be integrated into Bard.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-google-lumiere-multimodal-ai-video-model-9128622/,technology

"Bill Gates is excited about rapidly advancing robotics, says it won’t be taking all jobs",The billionaire philanthropist took to his blog to share his thoughts on robotics and how it can transform the way we live and work in the future.,"Robotics is the next frontier in technology. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence in recent times have accelerated the integration and deployment of AI. Numerous companies around the world have integrated AI into their robots that have been developed for various use cases. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, who is a vocal proponent of AI, took to his blog to share his thoughts about the advancements in robotics technology.
In his post, Gates expressed his excitement about the rapid progress in robotics technology and the potential for robots to transform how we live and work. While the billionaire outlined some limitations, he also stated that the innovations in AI are enabling them to demonstrate human-like capabilities in domains such as learning, understanding, and thinking.
The 68-year-old believes that robots can undertake dangerous and unfulfilling jobs, making people safer, healthier, and more productive. He went on to highlight some of the robotics companies that are at the forefront of developing humanoid robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. He also sees the possibility for robots to be active in healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and even in homes in the future.
On robots taking jobs
Gates acknowledged the fear of robots taking over jobs; however, he feels that governments and the private sector will need to help people brave this transition.

“I understand concerns about robots taking people’s jobs, an unfortunate consequence of almost every new innovation—including the internet, which (for example) turned everyone into a travel agent and eliminated much of the vacation-planning industry. If robots have a similar impact on employment, governments and the private sector will have to help people navigate the transition,” he wrote.
The billionaire said that considering the shortages in the economy and the dangerous and unrewarding nature of certain jobs, robots are unlikely to take jobs that we love, and more likely, they will take over jobs that people are unwilling to do. “I believe it’s less likely that robots will replace us in jobs we love and more likely that they’ll do work people don’t want to be doing. In the process, they can make us safer, healthier, more productive, and even less lonely.”
The limitless possibilities
When it comes to robotics, Gates feels if the technology is used the right way, there would be limitless use cases. According to Gates, robots can help during natural disasters where first responders would have to risk their lives or during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic when human interactions may spread the disease further. Robotics can help in manually pulling out weeds from farms instead of toxic chemical herbicides. They can also help move massive loads on factory floors. They can also be beneficial in prosthetics.

Gates went on to list some of the robotics companies that are doing something remarkable. In Agriculture, Tevel’s fruit-picking robots can work round the clock to address labour shortages and prevent crop wastage. Similarly, Apptronik is developing general-purpose humanoid robots that can be programmed to do various tasks. UCLA’s RoMeLa lab has developed ARTEMIS, one of the world’s fastest-running robots. Startups like Field AI are focused on developing AI software to improve robots’ perception, navigation, and communication abilities.
Gates, who frequently shares his thoughts on AI, had, in a recent interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that generative AI had plateaued and that GPT-5 will not be much different. In the same interview, the Microsoft co-founder also predicted that in the next two to five years, the accuracy of AI software will witness a considerable increase along with a cost reduction. This will lead to the creation of new and reliable applications.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/bill-gates-on-robotics-artificial-intelligence-9127474/,technology

The Minimal Phone channels BlackBerry vibes with keyboard and E Ink display,This phone is a throwback taking aim at distraction-free productivity.,"The smartphone world is dominated by big, colourful touchscreen devices like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. But a new crowdfunded phone called the Minimal Phone is going back to basics with a throwback design featuring a physical keyboard and black and white E Ink display.
Minimal Phone is the creation of Minimal Company, which plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign in early February to manufacture at least 3,000 units. The company says the phone’s final design is complete and aims to ship the device later this year if funding goals are met.
This isn’t your typical smartphone. Instead of a bright LCD or OLED screen, Minimal Phone uses a power-friendly monochrome E Ink display like you’d find on an e-reader. This provides easy outdoor readability and uses less electricity, allowing the phone’s 4,000 mAh battery to last up to 4 days on a charge according to Minimal Company.

The tradeoff is that an E Ink display isn’t ideal for video or motion-heavy games. It’s not like you’ll not be able to play those at all, but the display technology is definitely not suited for such use. However, for those looking to minimize distractions and focus on communication and productivity probably wouldn’t need support for it anyway. The Minimal Phone is meant to offer digital detox while still providing smartphone capabilities, after all.
Despite the minimalist aesthetic, founder Andre Youkhana says the phone will have modern features like a touch-enabled E Ink screen, camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, global cellular connectivity, and Android OS with Google Play support. The company is also exploring 5G capabilities.
At 120 x 72 x 10mm, the phone has a compact form factor reminiscent of older BlackBerry designs thanks to its full QWERTY keyboard. This physical keyboard complements the E Ink display for efficient typing and messaging.
Minimal Phone’s pared-down MinimalOS comes preloaded with a curated set of apps focused on productivity and privacy. With prices starting around $400 (Rs 33,250), it aims to provide core smartphone functionality at an affordable price point for the niche audience seeking a simpler mobile experience.

That said, the Kickstarter launch will determine if there’s enough interest to put the Minimal Phone into production. There’s even a chance it may never go into production at all if the funding needs aren’t met or an unexpected snag gets in the way – but we’re hoping it all goes smoothly.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/minimal-phone-distraction-free-e-ink-display-9127118/,technology

"NASA, Boeing plan to send astronauts on Starliner spacecraft this April",The much delayed first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner is now being planned for mid-April.,"After years of delays, NASA said on Wednesday it is planning to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft no earlier than mid-April.
The space agency says significant progress has been made in resolving technical issues that were identified during the spacecraft’s flight certification process. Starliner went through a successful drop test earlier this month. Teams from NASA and Boeing are conducting the final analysis of the data to complete overall system certification ahead of its first crewed flight.
NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 to develop crew transport systems to carry astronauts into space. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract, while SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion. Elon Musk-led SpaceX completed its first crewed flight in 2020, and it has carried more than a dozen crewed flights to the space station since then, along with many cargo flights. Boeing, meanwhile, has only completed two uncrewed flight tests of Starliner.
In the background, Boeing completed the removal of over seven kilograms of the P213 tape that could pose a fire risk in some conditions. In parts of the spacecraft where removing the tape could lead to other hardware issues, the company overwrapped the P213 tape with a different non-flammable, chafe-resistant tap and installed fire breaks on wire harnesses.
Major integrated flight operations exercises are also underway with mission support teams recently completed a two-day undocking to landing mission dress rehearsal at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-crewed-flight-9127033/,technology

40 years of Apple Macintosh: 3 lesser-known facts about the ‘icon’ that changed personal computers forever,"The first Apple Macintosh was announced in October 1983 and introduced on January 24, 1984, by Steve Jobs.","40 years after the launch of the first Macintosh, two things have changed: Apple has become a 3 trillion-dollar tech juggernaut, and the iPhone has laid the foundation for a modern smartphone, changing how we interact with our devices forever.

Tesla will start making new EV model in second half of 2025,"The EV maker also warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.","Tesla expects to start production of its long-anticipated, next-generation electric vehicle at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday.
But Tesla shares were down 6.5% in premarket trading as Musk noted that ramping up production of the new vehicle would be challenging and Tesla also warned of sharp slowdown in sales growth this year before the new model launch. Musk said it would take “a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology” required – a sign that any boost to Tesla’s declining pace of growth would take time.
His projection followed a Reuters story earlier in the day saying Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for a June 2025 startup of a smaller crossover vehicle, critical for the automaker as it loses share to inexpensive EVs such as those made by China’s BYD.
“I’m often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in the second half,” Musk told analysts on a post-earnings call.

“We’ll be sleeping on the line practically,” he said, referring to Tesla’s factory in Texas, where the new model will be first produced. That will be followed by Mexico and another factory outside North America to be decided later this year, he said.
The EV maker also warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.
Tesla said it was in between two growth waves: one driven by the release of Models 3 and Y in 2017 and 2020, respectively, and a second wave that would start with the next-generation vehicle platform.
ADVERTISEMENT
Wall Street expects Tesla to sell 2.2 million vehicles this year, according to Visible Alpha. That would be up about 21% from 2023 but well below the long-term target of 50% that Musk set about three years ago. Tesla, however, did not reiterate that target on Wednesday.
After years of breakneck growth, Tesla is bracing for slowing growth and margins as EV demand softens and competition intensifies.
“If volume’s going to be lower, then my guess is, Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at shareholder Hodges Capital Management.
Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in the fourth quarter, but Tesla cautioned it was approaching “the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup,” underscoring the pressure on the company to launch its new lower-cost vehicles. BYD sold more EVs globally than Tesla in the fourth quarter.

Musk said Chinese automakers will have significant success outside of China. “If there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”
Tesla reported a gross margin of 17.6% for the three months ended December, compared with 23.8% a year earlier, and analysts’ average estimate of 18.3%, according to LSEG data.
Automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits – a closely watched figure – dropped to 17.2% from 24.3% a year earlier, although it improved from 16.3% in the third quarter.
“Today’s flat sales and substantially reduced margin results are further evidence that Tesla is losing its leadership advantage and its brand leadership has weakened,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand.

MORE PRICE CUTS?
Tesla slashed prices of its cars since late 2022, igniting a price war that singed U.S. rivals including Ford, who have all slowed EV production.
Musk said on Wednesday that Tesla’s margins will depend on how fast interest rates fall.
Its stock, which has enjoyed valuations of a technology company partly due to Musk’s promise of self-driving cars, has fallen 16% so far this year, after doubling in 2023
“I don’t think the price cuts are over, mainly for the reason that demand for its electric vehicles is still weak,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Net income more than doubled from the previous year to $7.9 billion, including a $5.9 billion noncash gain related to deferred tax assets. Tesla said lower raw material costs and U.S. government credits helped lower cost-per-vehicle, but Cybertruck production and AI and other research projects increased costs.
On an adjusted basis, Tesla earned 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter, missing an average analysts’ estimate of 74 cents, according to LSEG data.
Tesla’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 3% to $25.17 billion, which marked its slowest pace of growth in more than three years.

Spotify to start in-app purchases on iPhone in Europe after DMA takes effect,"Under the DMA, which all Big Tech firms must comply with by March 7, companies are obligated to treat their own products and services like they do rivals'.","Spotify users in Europe can start to buy audiobooks and subscription plans from within the music-streaming app from March as a result of the region’s new competition law for Big Tech, the Swedish company said on Wednesday.
The move will help the company avoid Apple’s 30% fee for purchases through its App Store, which has long been a source of contention between app developers and the tech giant.
Spotify has for years been embroiled in a legal battle, alleging that it was forced to raise the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs tied to Apple’s App Store rules.
U.S.-listed shares of the Stockholm-based company rose around 2%.

“For years Apple had these rules where we couldn’t tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it,” Spotify said in a blogpost.
“The DMA (Digital Markets Act) means that we’ll finally be able to share details about deals, promotions, and better-value payment options in the EU.”

Apple plans to challenge the European Union’s decision to put all of App Store into the bloc’s new digital antitrust list, Bloomberg News had reported in November.
On Tuesday, Apple asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit worth around $1 billion brought on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers over its App Store rules.
Apple had also drawn criticism from Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg who called App Store policies and fee structure as problematic and causing a conflict of interest.
“We’ve always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps, and new options would add more competition in this space,” Meta said on Wednesday.

Asus bets big on ‘AI PCs’ to drive growth in India,Asus also says that reaching customers across India's towns/cities is key to company's growth. It's now present in 600 out of 750 districts with 250+ exclusive stores in the country.,"The buzz around artificial intelligence PCs is growing louder by the day, thanks largely to Microsoft’s big push for these next-gen laptops and desktops. But what exactly are AI PCs and how critical will they be for the future of personal computing? According to Arnold Su, vice president of consumer and gaming PCs at Asus India, AI PCs are the new cutting edge but will become standard in the next 5-10 years.
“From a business perspective, what we are looking at AI PCs is similar to the evolution of smartphones 10-12 years ago. Back then, smartphones were treated as a novelty just like how AI PCs are viewed today. But now, nobody talks about smartphones anymore. They are just phones. Similarly, 5-10 years down the line, AI PCs will just become PCs with AI features being standard,” said Su.
Asus is already beginning to integrate basic AI capabilities into its laptop lineup. “What you have seen right now and you will see with our upcoming launches is, we have enhanced our camera technologies and we’ve also enhanced our noise cancellation capabilities. The integration of all these systems we have started in 2021 itself and now with the new chips and new applications building in, we will continue to enhance the customer experience from that. And going forward, you will have more stuff to look forward to,” noted Su.
The ‘AI PC’ trend was kicked off earlier this year by Microsoft, which introduced a dedicated ‘Copilot’ key on its PCs. Other brands are expected to follow suit. (Image: Microsoft)
However, Asus’ current AI integration focuses more on things like computer vision and audio processing rather than bleeding-edge generative AI abilities seen in models like ChatGPT. When asked if Asus has any specific plans to build proprietary generative AI tools, Su did not divulge much. “I can’t talk about future plans at the moment, but currently we are working with multiple partners and we look forward to what we can achieve internally and then we’ll bring the best stuff out for the customers,” he hinted.
While the PC market declined in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, Asus India managed to buck the trend and record strong growth. Su believes reaching customers across India through online and offline channels is key to Asus’ success.
“Because India is such a big country, making every product available is very important. So from the PC market point of view, there are three major verticals in India – online space, large format retailer, and the traditional channel. We make our products available through online platforms, large format retail stores as well as the traditional channel which still accounts for 50% of the market. We have partner shops in over 400 districts currently where customers can experience our laptops first-hand before buying. This experience is critical and sets us apart,” explained Su.
Asus now has over 250 exclusive stores across India covering 600 out of 750 districts. The goal is to expand to more towns and cities to stay the second-largest PC brand in India.
ADVERTISEMENT
In Su’s words, “In Q3 2022, Asus became the number two consumer PC brand in India for the first time, overtaking HP. For 2023, we want to secure this second spot. We will continue focusing on bringing the latest tech across India’s towns and cities.”
This focus on India is not just lip service but core to Asus’ global market strategy. “India is always the first wave country for any new Asus product launch globally. It is our first priority within the company,” emphasised Su.
Contrary to the belief that entry-level devices drive volumes in India, Su has realised that Indian consumers are willing to spend more for better experiences.
“Over the years, we’ve seen Indian customers prefer mainstream and premium laptops over entry-level options. When they invest in a device, they want the satisfaction of having bought the latest tech that meets their needs, regardless of the price point,” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asus will continue to focus on bringing cutting-edge yet practical innovation to consumers across segments, without fixating on any particular form factor or specification.
“We launched gaming two-in-ones, dual screen, foldable, and handheld gaming PCs last year. There may not be one definitive laptop form factor in the future. As a PC innovator, we will keep bridging the gap between users’ needs and devices,” concluded Su on what customers can expect from Asus moving forward.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/asus-ai-pc-focus-india-growth-9125693/,technology

Watch: Asteroid burns up over Germany hours after it was discovered,Watch videos of a small asteroid as it hurtled towards Earth and burned up in the atmosphere.,"Early on Sunday morning, a tiny asteroid hurtled towards Earth, entered its atmosphere and exploded in a ball of fire above Nennhausen in Germany, west of Berlin. The asteroid was harmless, and researchers detected it three hours before impact.
Such asteroid entries usually happen a few times a year, but this one was special because it was detected before it hit, according to Live Science. This is only the eighth time that scientists have spotted one of these asteroids before it hit the planet’s atmosphere. “Heads Up: A tiny asteroid will disintegrate as a harmless fireball west of Berlin near Nennhausen shortly at 1:32 AM CET. Overseers will see it if it’s clear!,” shared NASA’s Asteroid Watch team on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday.
When the asteroid arrived, it was far from inconspicuous and social media was flooded with videos of the asteroid’s descent over Europe. Denis Vida, a PhD associate in meteor physics at Western University in Canada, shared this video of the asteroid that was captured by a camera livestreaming from the Augustusplatz square in the city of Germany.
Here’s the full video of the asteroid #Sar2736, a ~1 m object that broke up some 50 m west of #Belin, #Germany, and probably dropped some meteorites on the ground. Video credit: https://t.co/72o6ZzPNz8 pic.twitter.com/PA73dkqid1
